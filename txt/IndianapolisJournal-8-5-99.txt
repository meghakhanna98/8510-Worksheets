Special to the Indianapolis Journal.
MUNCIE, Ind., Aug. 4. Buffalo Bill's Wild West show and the street-car company collided at the corner of Main and Walnut streets on the public square during the parade to-day and a riot almost resulted by excited men interfering In behalf of the how company. Manager Baldwin, of the street railway, desired to dictate the route of the parade and when turned down ordered his several motormen to run right through the parade. At the above corner the dense crowd blockaded the car, and one of the show wagons took a part by stopping across the track with the manager, a driver and an Indian in it. Baldwin relieved the motor man and attempted to bump the wagon from the track. A policeman was called and pulled his big revolver to force the show wagon to move on; but the crowd would not permit it and threatened to derail the car and pounce upon Baldwin, when Superintendent Cashmere, of the police force, interfered and checked Baldwin. The show was given morning and evening in a drenching rain and one, of the performers, Fred Huffman, of Buffalo, had a leg broken. Eighteen thousand witnessed the performances afternoon and night.
