WILD WEST SHOW AT SPENCER PARK

It is definitely announced that the Buffalo Bill show which will appear in this city on Friday, July 29, will show at Spencer Park. Agents of the show have contracted with the street car company for the use of the enclosure within the Spencer Park race track. The show cars will be deliver probably at Seventeenth street from which place the circus will be hauled out the George street road to the park. The haul is a very long one for a circus but the wild west show has much lighter property than the canvas roof aggregation and will be able to make the haul on time. 

The street car company will arrange to have a continual string of cars running to and from the park during the day.
