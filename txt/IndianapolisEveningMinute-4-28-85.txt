Indianapolis Evening Minute April 28, 1885 pg. 2
The famous scout, guide and hunter, Buffalo Bill (Hon. William F. Cody), with his famous "Wild West" show, will be here this week, exhibiting on Tuesday and Wednesday afternoons next, at the State Fair grounds. The "Wild West" is a novel and original entertainment, and is an accurate photograph of Western life, including an Indian attack on a stage coach, herding cattle, an elk hunt, horse races, and some marvelous exhibitions of riding and shooting, by both Buffalo Bill and Captain Bogardus. These are a number of other features presented by this unique combination. Down to its smallest detail the show is genuine- cowboys, vaqueros, Indians, stage-coach, costumes, and all.
