Logansport Pharos Tribune April 28, 1885 pg. 4
Logansport will be treated to the same as two circuses in as many weeks. On Saturday afternoon Buffalo Bill and his Wild West combination will hold forth at the fair grounds. On Friday of next week the Doris circus will be here with all its grand attractions. What with the above, the skating rink, Carleton's opera company and the election, amusements seem to be crowding upon us.
