A CHARACTERISTIC LETTER. 
Mark Twain Votes with the Very Large Majority.
When Buffalo Bill arrived at Scranton, this State, he received the following characteristic letter from Sam Clemens, better known as "Mark Twain." The letter followed Mr. Cody, and "caught on" at Scranton: 
Elmira, N. Y., September 10. 
Dear Mr. Cody: 
I have now seen your Wild West show two days in succession, and have enjoyed it thoroughly. It brought vividly back the breezy wild life of the Great Plains and the Rocky Mountains, and stirred me like a war-song. Down to its smallest details the show is genuine- cowboys, vaqueros, Indians, stagecoach, costumes and all; it is wholly free from sham and insincerity; and the effects produced upon me by its spectacles were identical with those wrought upon me a long time ago by the same spectacles on the frontier. Your pony expressman was as tremendous an interest to me yesterday as he was twenty-three years ago, when he used to come whizzing by from over the desert with the war news; and your bucking horses were even painfully real to me, as I rode one of those outrages once for nearly a quarter of a minute. It is often said on the other side of the water, that none of the exhibitions which we send to England are purely and distinctively American. If you will take that Wild West show over there, you can remove that reproach.        Truly yours, 
Mark Twain.
