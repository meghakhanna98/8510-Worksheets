Indianapolis Journal, 10 May 1896
Gathering Them In. The police yesterday gathered in a few of the supposed thieves and pickpockets who follow the Buffalo Bill Wild West show. John W. Terry and Michael McDonough were the names given by a couple of men whom officers saw acting suspiciously on Washington Street. They were sent to the police station, and when searched were found to have revolvers in their possession. Later in the day Captain Splan and detective McGuff taw a stranger and a known thief in the crowd on West Washington Street. The men ran at the sight of the officers, but the, stranger was captured as he attempted to board a car. He gave his name as E. L. Dawson.
