RECEPTION

WELL, IT WAS FINE CIRCUS!

***Line appears to be misplaced bit of type, matches with sentence later on in the article***

Sells-Floto circus with its army of artists who appeared before a good sized crowd yesterday afternoon and evening will be more welcome than ever when it returns, provided it so good and clean entertainment as it did yesterday. A superfluity of cheap carnivals and a wild west show earlier in the season took the edge off the public’s circus taste Monday and that probably accounted for one empty section of seats.

Buffalo Bill appeared before the spectators in person and intimated that next season the Buffalo Bill wild west will be seen as a separate show again. He said the part with the Sells-Floto circus was not the complete wild west show which people learned to now in the world fair days in Chicago. His statement evidently is preparing the public for the big and complete wild west show next season

A “widow” who whispered into the ears and fell fainting into the arms of unsuspecting men as they marched into the big tent to find reserved seats before the opening of the regular performance, alone was worth the price ***of horsemanship was of a superior*** in a constant roar of laughter. The animal acts were good and the trapeze work was splendid.

The wild west cowgirl, cowboys and Indians were good but lacked originality, due largely to the arrangement of the tent with its three rings were a handicap to them. Every phase of horsemanship was of a superior quality. 

Hammond undoubtedly will be a circus city for many years to come but of late years the tents are pitched on the Illinois side and the license fees go to West Hammond. In Hammond it is felt, and the managements of the circus fee the same way, that the patronage from the North township cities would be very much greater if the tents could be pitched nearer the center of the population.
