Ft. Wayne Sentinel June 26 1896
It should be considered a duty by all parents to send or take their children to see Buffalo Bill's Wild West and Congress of Rough Riders of the World. They may never have another opportunity to see the soldiers of the world in one assemblage, to say nothing of seeing one of the most striking characters in American history, as Buffalo Bill is generally acknowledged to be. The Indians and the buffalo are rapidly becoming extinct, and they learn that which they may impart to their children. There is nothing that can be objectionable to the most refined ladies and children in the wonderful exhibition. This will probably be the last opportunity they will ever have to see it, and that part of their education should not be either delayed or neglected.
