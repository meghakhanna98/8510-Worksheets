HERALS COMING OF BUFFALO BILL

***Large cartoon caricature of Maj. John M. Burke on horseback***

An enormous embonpoint bounced over the sidewalks of Indianapolis yesterday, and a wide-brimmed black at and side whiskers flopped in an occasional breeze. Behind the embonpoint and between the whiskers was Maj. John M. Burke, 70 years old, defying the heat and amusing himself by observing scenes that are new to a larger Indianapolis. Maj. Burke is the oldest press agent in America, and although he tips the beam at more than 200 pounds, is not by any means slow in getting his own and the name of his attraction in print. Maj. Burke is advance man, historian and a general information bureau ahead of the Buffalo Bill-Pawnee Bill Show, which will be seen here Monday. He has been “ahead of Buffalo Bill” continuously since 1873, and in that time he has visited practically every large city in the world. Besides talking himself into the columns of newspapers Maj. Burke has also talked himself into the presence of kings, to whom he has explained Buffalo Bill’s fame. 

Burke has been a friend of Buffalo Bill’s since the early days, and he amuses his friends frequently by telling of Bill’s debut on the stage. Buffalo Bill was appearing in Chicago in a Western drama. He was supposed to drive on the stage to give a demonstration of Wild West shooting and “bad: talk. One night the stage manager told Buffalo Bill that his “bad” talk was not “bad” enough nor as realistic as it should be. The next time Bill appeared he cut loose some genuine ranch conversation that left the atmosphere blue and the audience in an uproar. 

“Of course Buffalo Bill will be here with the show,” said the major. “He is just as good yet as I am, and he will be for several years.” 
To demonstrate how full of youth he is the major danced a clog dance and called himself the White Hope.
