Buffalo Bill Used to It
Pittsburg Chronicle Telegraph
Buffalo Bill is indignant at the invasion of Indian's rights to wear his hair long and grease his face. He takes it as a sign that patent-leather shoes and porcelain-lined bathtubs will doubtless be the next step in the elevation of the Indian. But then it must be remembered that Mr. Cody is used to the Indian in his original picturesque attire. Then, too, Buffalo Bill wears his own hair long.
