‘Nother Circus Comin’

“Circus comin,” said the press agent.

“Space tight – war, y’know,” answered the city editor.

“Write a little story – huh?” the P.A. was insistent

“Sure – but cut it to the bone,”

And here’s what came to the copy desk:

“Comin’-circus Biggest circus in world. Circus and Wild West all mixed together. Sells-Floto Circus and Buffalo Bill (himself). Be here Monday, Sept. 21. Indians, riders, ropers, soldiers, lots a Wild West stuff. Whole slew o’ circus too, - even forty clowns. Buffalo Bill himself with show – salutes from saddle. Leads parade.”
