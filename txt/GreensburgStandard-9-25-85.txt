Greensburg Standard September 25, 1885 pg. 4
We have been favored with complimentaries to Buffalo Bill's Wild West which will give exhibitions of western border life at the 7th Street Base Ball Park, at Indianapolis, Ind., commencing September 30, giving performances daily, rain or shine, during the week of the State Fair. The performances have been reconstructed and improved, and the company has been enlarged since the last appearance in that city. The latest acquisition is the renowned Sioux Chief, Sitting Bull, and several of the celebrated warriors lately among the hostiles, including White Eagle and fifty-two Pawnee and Wichita braves. The programme contains some remarkably astonishing exhibitions of marksmanship by Buffalo Bill, Miss Anna Oakley, and cow-boys Johnny Baker and Seth Clover.
