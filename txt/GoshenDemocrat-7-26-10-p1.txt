IN GOSHEN TOMORROW: Buffalo Bill’s Wild West and Pawnee Bill’s Far East have Combined

Two men of marvelous achievements have combined in one enterprise exhibition, which for more than a quarter of a century, have stood the test of public expectations. Col. Wm F. Cody, the only and original “Buffalo Bill,’ and Major Gordon W. Lillie, known to fame as “Pawnee Bill,” who have, in friendly rivalry, been previously identified with two separate institutions of amusement. Two hemispheres are now contrasted in a series of scenes and types, authentically correct and historically accurate. The world’s horsemen and the world’s people are grouped in living representations of heroic epochs; the historic past lives again in vistas of a bygone era. In its ethnological mélange the red man of the prairies touches shoulders with the denizens of the Soudan; reckless Cossacks from the Steppes of Russia, daring cowboys from the Western plains, the Bedouin horseman from the Sahara and Gauchos from the South American pampas display their saddle expertness in visual comparison. The observant and interested student finds ample food for thought, while the votaries of pure amusement are rewarded in abundance. There is novelty and diversion in every number from the time the mighty cavalcade of horsemen, led by the original and only Col. Wm. F. Cody, “Buffalo Bill,” enters the arena. The Indian battle of Summit Springs gives way to the Oriental Spectacle; the bucking horse and Indian pony of the plains retires in favor of the elephant and camel; Arabian acrobats, Whirling Dervishes, Hinddo fakirs, and other strange people from many climes are sown in a conglomeration of brilliant scenes and strenuous activities.
