"I'm going to Europe in April," said Buffalo Bill to a Philadelphia reporter, "and the show goes along, to be gone two of three years. I've given up the stage entirely. We'll show in the Alexandria Palace in London, in the Champs de Mars in Paris, and also in Vienna, Berlin, Moscow, and St. Petersburg, and hundreds of smaller places. We shall go to Europe in a special steamer." Buffalo Bill is 43 years old, weighs 210 pounds, stands six feet three inches, and has never been sick in his life. He says he has the largest thoroughbred stock farm in America, at North Platte, Lincoln County, Neb. The ranch consists of 8,000 acres under one fence, and his claims that the land is not wild Government land, but paid for by him. He owns twelve dwellings in the town, and his own house is a Western palace. Recently, while in Chicago, he bought forty-one head of imported cattle of the Hereford and Poll-Angus breeds, and paid on an average $461 a piece for them. They were shipped to his stock farm. He employs over one hundred men on his farm, and is worth $450,000. He has been a member of the Legislature, a Probate Judge, High Sheriff, and Justice of the Peace. He says he is just in his prime, and feels like a young buck every morning when he gets up, and that he can jump a fence or ride a horse with any man he ever saw.
