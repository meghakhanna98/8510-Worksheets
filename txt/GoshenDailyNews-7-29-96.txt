Buffalo Bill And his Wild West Show are worth going miles to see. 50 cts. is the price of admission, and 9c more gives you your choice of any Shirt Waist at The Big Store. Just think of it 59c for Waists worth $1.48, $1.29 and 98c. But the balance of the stock must go, no matter what the sacrifice.
