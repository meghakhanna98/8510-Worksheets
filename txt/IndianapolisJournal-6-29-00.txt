SIOUX INDIAN'S DEATH. 
He Succumbed to Canned Corn - Member of Cody's show. 
DANBURY, Conn., June 28. - Man-Afraid-of-a-Hawk, aged twenty-one, a full-blooded Sioux Indian, connected with Buffalo Bill's show, died at the Danbury Hospital tonight after a brief illness from inflammation of the stomach. Eagle Bear, another member, is also in a critical condition. A number of other attaches of the show were ill on their arrival here this morning, but with the exception of the two Indians none of the cases are serious. It is believed the men were made sick by eating canned corn.
