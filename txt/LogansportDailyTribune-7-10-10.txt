SHOW SITE NOW UPON WEST SIDE

In contradiction of the first announcement that the Buffalo Bill show would appear at the Spencer Park race track on July 29 when the show comes to this city, was yesterday received a correction from L.W. Murray, press agent of the show. The circus will exhibit on the Kennedy Circus grounds on the West Side.

The managers had previously considered placing the show at Spencer Park and had gone so far as to prepare advertisements with that announcement. 

The alteration in arrangements was made this week after advance men came here and looked over the ground deciding that the show could not but lose by making the long haul to the park where there should be street car power trouble or bad weather, no crowed of any size could be obtained.
