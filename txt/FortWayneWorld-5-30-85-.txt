Fort Wayne World May 30, 1885
Buffalo Bill will be here Monday and Tuesday next. The Albany Argus gives him the following notice in a recent issue: "The threadbare and uninteresting circus, which has for years been the main out door spectacular pleasure of the people, has a vigorous rival in Buffalo Bill's new and novel venture called the "Wild West." Probably 5,000 people from Troy and Albany visited its first representation at Island Park yesterday afternoon. No brief notice can present an idea of the features of the enterprise. It is marvelous in many things and uninteresting in nothing. It is literally the "Wild West" at our very doors. The hazards of occidental travel are pertrayed by an attack upon deadwood coach, the realism of which lacks nothing but bullets and death. Cowboys, scouts, trappers, representatives of the Arraphoe, Sioux and Pawnee Indians, Mexican vaqueros, buffaloes, Indian ponies, mountain sheep, elk, steers and Mexican burros, together make up the combination which presents vividly a hundred scenes familiar in the romance and reality of the plains. Buffalo Bill and the others live again in scenes that are shorn of nothing but their original danger- handle the gun with an accuracy that has won them fame.
