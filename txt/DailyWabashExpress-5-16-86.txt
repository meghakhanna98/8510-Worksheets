Don't fail to see the greatest cavalcade of genuine western celebrities, headed by Hon. W. F. Cody (Buffalo Bill) and the Sioux chief American Horse, ever witnessed in the precincts of civilization. Street parade at 10 a.m., or as soon as possible after the arrival of the train, Monday morning, May 17. See it, and wait for nothing else on earth.
