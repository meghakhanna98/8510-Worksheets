INDIANS AND SHOWMEN.
The Latter Required To Give Bond For Fulfillment of Their Contracts. [Special to the Indianapolis News.]
Washington, D. C., March 23.-The Secretary of the Interior has just settled the annual controversy with Buffalo Bill, Pawnee Bill, and the other promoters of "Wild West shows," about taking Indians abroad for exhibition. At the beginning of each show season it is necessary for the proprietors of the shows to procure the Secretary's permission before they can take the Indians off the reservations. The humane society, and others interested in the Indians' welfare, always vigorously oppose the granting of permission to take the Indians abroad or to permit them to go into the show business. In justification of this opposition it is claimed that the show business is demoralizing to the Indian, and that the show proprietors often abuse them and fail to keen their contracts.
That this claim is not always not well founded, is shown by the ironclad contract which the Government exacts from the show managers. Buffalo Bill and his rivals in the business are compelled to sign a large bond for the safe performance of their contracts with the Indians. They also sign a contract with the Secretary of the Interior to pay the transportation abroad and return of the Indians, and also fix the salaries that they are to be paid, and guarantee them proper treatment. As a general thing the Indians are very anxious to sign with the showmen. Pawnee Bill has just filed a bond of $30,000 to the Secretary of the Interior for the privilege of exporting a number of Indians for show purposes at the Antwerp Exposition.
