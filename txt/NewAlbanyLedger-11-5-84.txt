Buffalo Bill
Buffalo Bill's great Wild West will exhibit at Eclipse Base Ball grounds, Louisville, on Friday, Saturday and Sunday. This is one of the most exciting shows on the road, giving the spectator a fine exhibit of Western life in a few hours.
Hon. W. S. Cody is the original Buffalo Bill, and will be with the party in person, which insures a splendid entertainment, so chaste and moral that none need fear to attend.
