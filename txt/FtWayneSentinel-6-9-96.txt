Ft. Wayne Sentinel June 9 1896
One hundred and sixty of the principal cities of the cast were visited by Buffalo Bill's Wild West and Congress of Rough Riders of the World last year. Not once did it fail to arrive on time, and Col. Cody (Buffalo Bill) took part in every exhibition, as he will do when it comes here on Monday, June 29, at Lakeside.
