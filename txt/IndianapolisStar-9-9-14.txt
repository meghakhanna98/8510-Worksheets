BIG CIRCUS DUE SEPT. 21. HAS DOUBLED SIZE IN YEAR

This is the story of how a circus grew – and it also is the reason that when the announcements were made this year that the Sells Floto and Buffalo Bill was “bigger and better,” the phrase for once kept out of the category of “old stuff.” For the circus, which is to have a one-day exhibition in Indianapolis, Sept. 21, auto-matically double din size within a year – and here’s how it happened. 

When the Sells Floto circus took Buffalo Bill and his company of Indians, rough riders and others as a part of the attraction, expenses jumped. And since the price of 25 cents for general admission was to remain the same, it was necessary to make room for more people that the show might not lose money. Therefore, a new tent was purchased with a seating capacity for 11,000 persons. With a bigger tent there was more room within the performing arena, so two great steel arenas were added to the three rings and two stages. Two arenas meant more animal acts, so more animals were purchased. There was a time when thirty clowns looked like a good many under the old canvas. But the number jumped ten with the new tent. And in this way everything else increased around the circus –everything except the price. And since the circus doubled, the parade also did the same. Not it is two miles long and will come at 10:30 o’clock the day of the Indianapolis engagement. Incidentally, it is to be led by Col. William F. Cody, Buffalo Bill.
