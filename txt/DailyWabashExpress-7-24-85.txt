Providence, RI. July 23 - A.V.
Sarkee-solee-sharw, a Pawnee Indian, with Buffalo Bill's company, died yesterday and was buried today, with head to the eastward, in the Pocassett cemetery. The burial was solemn and impressive, the members of the band gathering at the grave and in their native tongue addressing the Great Spirit on behalf of their dead comrade.
