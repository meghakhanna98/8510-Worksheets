Indianapolis Monroe's Iron Clad Age June 16, 1883 pg. 5
Buffalo Bill made a stir here June 11th with his highly moral street parade. He had bison in herds, aboriginal man on horseback and toothsome venison without cranberry sauce. William Buffalo is quite a showman when it comes to scooping in the boys. The boys have Buffalo Bill mixed up in their imaginations with wild adventures on the boundless plains- such as scalping Indians, wrecking trains and robbing stage-coaches. And his show has therefore a wonderful attraction for the boy who has fed upon dime novels, is scheming to achieve a revolver and is planning a robbery of the "old man" and a run-away.
