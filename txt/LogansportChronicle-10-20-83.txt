Logansport Chronicle October 20, 1883 pg. 2
A Pennsylvania boy who had witnessed Buffalo Bill lasso buffalo became so infatuated that he purchased a rope and began to practice the art on hitching posts and dogs. Not liking small game he lassoed a passing coal car and as one end of the rope was tied to his body he was dragged some distance before the rope was cut by a switch bar. A train of cars never was successfully caught with a lasso.
