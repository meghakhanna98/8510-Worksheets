Ellettsville Monroe County Citizen July 14, 1894 pg. 4
Miss Cody, daughter of the great Buffalo Bill, who was with the Wild West Show at the World's Fair, will positively be at Bloomington with a number of other attractions from the Wild West Show. Her marksmanship with the rifle and revolver, have never been equaled on the continent. 

It is worth going 50 miles to see Miss Cody alone at the Big Bloomington Fair and her troop of Wild Indian Riders. Miss Cody is today shot and most daring, wild, rough rider in the world and she is only 20 years old. She takes her marksmanship from her father, the great Buffalo Bill and her wild, rough riding from her Indian mother. Remember she will be at the Big Bloomington Fair every day.
