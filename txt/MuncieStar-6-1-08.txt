SCENES FROM WILD WEST


Some --- Which Will Be Seen With Buffalo Bill


For his appearance in Muncie next Friday, Col. Wm. F. Cody has arranged a varied and extensive exhibition. The Wild West will present several historic scenes which will be practically open-air melodramas. The rough riders have been chosen with a view, first, to their expertness, and they will represent all equestrian nations of the world. The South American guacho[a] and the Mexican vaquero will ride in competition with Russian Cossacks and Japanese horsemen; the Indian, the cowboy and the western girl will be seen in feats of equestrian daring. There will be a delegation of English dragoons and Irish lancers; there will be Bedouin Arabs and German cuirassiers. Buffalo Bill will be in the saddle at every performance, leading his congress of rough riders, and he will also appear as the central figure in the battle of Summit Springs, a reproduction of the Indian battle in which he killed Chief Tall Bull, and which practically decided the campaign which terminated the Indian outbreaks in Colorado, Nebraska, and Wyoming. The great train hold-up will present a phase of western life which has developed since the Indians first realized that their hunting grounds were slipping away from them before the advance of commerce. In “A Holiday at T-E Ranch” of the plainsmen, and there will be shown the sports and pastimes of the plainsmen, and there will be presented a marked contrast to the peaceful scene of revelry in an Indian attack upon the ranch. In all particulars the Wild West will picture scenes true to life Col. Cody has ever maintained his exhibition historic, truthful, and, therefore, education.
