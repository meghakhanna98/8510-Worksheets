COL. CODY AND KING EDWARD: Famous American Scout Was Long a Close Personal Friend of England’s Late Monarch

Major Burke has been associated with “Buffalo Bill” ever since the old scout has been giving public exhibitions, and he probably has a greater fund of interesting experiences than any other man in the show business in American. He is one of the few veterans left who have spanned the ancient and modern epochs in cicusdom. Colonel Cody was a close friend of the late king of England, the friendship extending over a period of years. On nearly every occasion that Colonel Cody was in the company of the king Major Burke was at his side. So it came that the major likewise got to know the king personally, and he recalls now many of the incidents connected with his majesty. 

When the showman first met Edward, in 1887, he was the Prince of Wales. The major said he never was so dumbfounded in his life as when they began to talk about the plains and Indians of America to find King Edward was thoroughly acquainted with conditions here and knew many of the details unfamiliar even to the average American living in the east. He was a frequent visitor at their camp in Earl’s Court, and on one occasion personally conducted a private performance of the Wild West show, which was attended by the royal family and their guests. Before leaving England on that occasion Colonel Cody received a diamond ring and pin, the gifts of Queen Victoria and her son. These pieces of jewelry are the only ones that “Buffalo Bill” ever wore in his life and he is seldom seen without them.
