“The Redmen stealthily conceal themselves behind hills and rocks bent on pillage and massacre. The wagon train unconsciously reaches the concealed hostiles, and in less time than it takes to tell it, a war whoop! – and the pioneers turn their startled faces into the very teeth of the yelling and furious horde of merciless demons. A battle to the death ensues, defeat meaning torture and death for the whites. In the midst of the fearful combat the arena suddenly becomes (***)charged with cavalry and plainsmen who rush to the rescue of the settlers,”

No, gentle reader, this is not an excerpt from a Wild West “yellow-back” nor the scenario of a moving picture “thriller, but merely a press agent conception at least he says it is – of “Pioneer Events in Frontier Days,” the feature of the Buffalo Bill and Pawnee Bill Exposition, which will be in Indianapolis June 23.

The show was to have been in Indianapolis and other cities in this part of the country in September but the flood caused almost a complete reversal of its schedule. As usual, the press agent insists that Buffalo Bill himself will be with the show.
