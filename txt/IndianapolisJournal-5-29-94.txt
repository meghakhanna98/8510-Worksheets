Buffalo Bill is one of the most remarkable illustrations of the value of outdoor exercise at the present, time in the public eye. Mr. Cody is a little bit sensitive about his age, but no confidences are violated when it is said that in the opinion of his associates he is nearer to sixty than the fifty year mark. Yet he is as trim in build as a lieutenant of cavalry, has a clear skin, a bright eye and nothing to show his advanced years except the gray in his hair and moustache. He is in the saddle three or four hours a day.
