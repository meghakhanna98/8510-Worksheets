Buffalo Bill is Coming Back in Wild West Show

The Buffalo Bill (himself) – 101 ranch show will give two performances in South Bend, Thursday Aug. 17, and already a great deal of preliminary interest has been aroused. Two facts of especial interest to the public stand out in relief. The first is the fact that Col. William F. Cody, famous wherever men read tales of romance, as Buffalo Bill, is with the show in person and will be seen “in the addle at every performance.” The second is the new military spectacle

“Preparedness,” presented, it is announced, in cooperation with the United States war department, and enlisting the services of a large number of soldiers from the regular army, who have been given a furlough for the purpose. 
“Preparedness,” is evidently an ambitious display of military effectiveness as well as an illustration of the need of it. Every branch of the cavalry, infantry and artillery, and even the work of the Red Cross and the very essential commissary department is illustrated.

A combined military and frontier parade will take place at 10:30 show day, prior to the performances in the mammoth exhibition tents. 
An interesting incidental feature of the coming of the big show to South Bend will be a U. S> army recruiting tent, where enlistments will be received on the Mexican border.
