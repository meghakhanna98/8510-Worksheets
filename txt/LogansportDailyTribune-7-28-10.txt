Promotion

Col. Wm. F. Cody and Major Gordon W. Lillie, the well known “Buffalo Bill,” and “Pawnee Bill,” have united their forces for the purpose of giving the people of America an anthropological exhibit of the globe. Both of their expositions have made a wonderful record, and now that they are combined in the same arena, an amusement enterprise of rare interest will be found in the present attraction. 

Indian warriors from out West, Indian Malays from the far East, cowboys and girls, jugglers from Hindostam, trained elephants, which play o musical instruments, wild bucking broncos, camel caravans, Persian fire worshippers, Asiatic acrobat, Cossacks, Japanese Zouaves, the great Texas horse “Joe Bailey,” the United States cavalry and artillery, Buffalo Bill shooting from horse back and Johnny Baker at the traps; all of these and more will be seen. 

Messrs. Cody and Lillie have found that they have struck the keynote in amusement enterprise. Their success is deserved from the fact of always adding novelties to an already world-wide endorsed program of realistic features.
There will be no street parade: every energy of men and horses being devoted to giving perfect performances. 

Col. Cody has given none of these public processions for over ten years, their fatiguing effect on men, women and horse being such as to effect the snap, ginger and go necessary to a natural exhibition.
There will be two representations daily at 2 and 8 p.m. rain or shine.

The performances are given in the open while the spectators are comfortably seated under shed-canvases from sun or shower –arranged to secure fresh air – a seasonable summer entertainment. Colonel Cody on his coming visit will bid us farewell. 

The shows will be located on the Kennedy grounds on the West Side.
