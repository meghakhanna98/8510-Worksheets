TAKE THE CHILDREN: Parents Should Let Youngsters See Buffalo Bill

Parents owe it a duty to their children’s thirst for knowledge to have them see the Wild West and Far East. This combination of two exhibitions is one of the best opportunities to gratify their desires. There are very excellent reasons why they should be given a chance to attend this remarkable, elevating, instructive, and historical combination as this visit here July 29, marks Col. W. F. Cody’s, (Buffalo Bill), positive farewell. 

If there was as much “horse sense” in some of the “leaders of thought” and propounders of wisdom as there is in Buffalo Bill’s Wild West and Pawnee Bill’s Far East there would be a good deal less “bucking” in prosperity’s parade.

In the summer of 1883 Buffalo Bill’s Wild West created a line of outdoor, fresh air exhibitions that were novel and beneficial to the public. IN the winter of 1886 and 1887, in the most colossal scene spectacle the world ever saw before or since (presented at Madison Square Garden), it founded a new era in stage mechanism that has since had an inspiring effect on dramatic productions in the most celebrated homes of that art. Its continental and ocean tours mark a pioneering in that line that stands and probably will forever as an unequaled record. In 1910 and 1911 with its companion human kindergarten, Pawnee Bill’s Far East, its visits will be rendered memorable as celebrating the leavetaking from millions of admirers of it’s leader, Col. W. F. Cody, Buffalo Bill.
