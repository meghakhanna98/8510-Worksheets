North Manchester Journal October 4, 1883 pg. 2
The "Buffalo Bill Wild West" show, which has been exhibiting at different fair grounds over the country this summer, varied the show battles with a little real fighting at Cleveland, Ohio, last Sunday. An Omaha Indian named Walker, who is down on the bills as "Howling Dog," filled up with bad whisky, and started on the war-path. After he had laid out several fellow aborigines with the butt of his revolver, he made a charge on Buffalo Bill. The latter successfully dodged two shots, and then knocked down the red man with a shovel. Walker will be laid up about ten days. The other Indians were quite rampant for a while, and it looked as if there would be a small sized war, but quiet was finally restored before hostilities had assumed dangerous proportions.
