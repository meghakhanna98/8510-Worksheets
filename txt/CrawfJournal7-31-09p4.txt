Buffalo Bills Show

Gave First Performance This Afternoon and Will Be Here Tonight

Buffalo Bill’s wild west show came to town this morning and as usual when a circus comes to town, a large crowd saw the unloading on south Washington street. The show was in Danville, Ill., Friday night. It required two trains to transport the show. The first section reached here at half-past four. The wagons and animals were transported to the McFarland grounds on Lane avenue in the northwest part of the city. There was no parade. Despite the threatening weather a large crowd came to town long before the noon hour and the performance this afternoon was witnessed by an audience which filled the tents comfortably. It is expected that the crowd to-night will be big enough to pack the tent to its capacity. A clown driving an old battered wagon hitched to an old skate of a horse caused much merriment downtown on the main streets. A woman sat in the seat with him. They passed for farmer and wife. At intervals the horse would become frightened apparently, when the woman would grab the lines. A fuss followed every time and the joke to it was that everybody thought the trouble was real.
