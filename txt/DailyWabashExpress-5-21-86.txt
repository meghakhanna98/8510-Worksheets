Police Perversion.
During the two days that Buffalo Bill gave his exhibition at the Fairgrounds eight policemen were detailed there along fences to prevent persons getting into the grounds free. The policemen were on night duty and were told that they must do this extra service by order of the mayor. The Fairgrounds are outside of the city limits. It is safe to say that Mayor Kolsem issued no such order. The eight policemen received none of the pay for the extra service.
