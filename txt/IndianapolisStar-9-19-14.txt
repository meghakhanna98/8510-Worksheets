LITTLE FUZZY DOG CAUSED BIG CIRCUS TO BE STARTED

This is the story of a fuzzy little dog and it is the story of the reason that the Sells Floto Circus and Buffalo Bill will exhibit in Indianapolis for one day, Monday, Sept. 31. For had it not been for that fuzzy dog there would have been no Sells Floto circus to give an exhibition.

Let it be known in the first place that the owners of the circus also own a newspaper, the Denver Post. Now and then they meet press agents, and one day about fourteen  years ago, there walked into the office of H. H. Tammen, one of the owners of the show, the agent of a dog and pony exhibition. A small fuzzy dog was with him. Mr. Tammen glanced toward the floor.

“I want that dog.” He said

The press agent grinned.

“and do I get my notices in the paper?” He asked.

“That goes without saying” came the answer “And do I get the dog?”

“You do.”

And so it came about tha a circus trick dog made his home in the offices of the Denver Post. It came about also that one day H. H. Tammen walked into the office of his partner. 

“Bonfiels,” he said, “this dog’s given me an ambition. I want to start a circus. Are you in on it?”

“I am” came the reply, and the work was begun.

That was years ago and the Sells Floto circus started as a dog and pony show. Today – well, since the combination with Buffalo Bill the seating capacity of 14,000 and more than 1,000 are necessary to the making of the program of the show’s performance. As for the dog which gave the inspiration for it all – there is nothing more revered in the hearts of F. G. Bonfiels and H. H. Tammen.

The circus when it comes here, is to exhibit on the West Washington street grounds. There is to be a parade, of course, and it will be led by Buffalo Bill himself.
