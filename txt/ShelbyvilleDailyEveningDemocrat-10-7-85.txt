Shelbyville Daily Evening Democrat October 7, 1885 
-Clay Freeman and Jack Hews, constable of this place, gave a Buffalo Bill exhibition here Sunday. For the last few days Freeman has been on a big hurrah, and Sunday he was shooting recklessly in the air. Hews tried to put a stop to it, but Freeman ran him home with his revolver and the constable fell over the gate. Freeman attempted to follow, but Hews was near home and his bravery returned and he turned on Freeman and hit him in the mouth. He then ran in the house, got his revolver and ran Freeman off. It was a very interesting entertainment.
