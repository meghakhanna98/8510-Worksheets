Maj. Burke Says Buffalo Bill Has Assumed Role of Educator 

Col. Cody (Buffalo Bill) is to spend his latter days as an educator and entertainer in combination with the Sells-Floto circus which is coming to Indianapolis Monday. 

Maj John M. Burke, who for years has heralded the arrival of Buffalo Bill in all parts of the world is now sounding the praises of Sells-Floto and Buffalo Bill newly arranged combination of artistic skill, national history and historic personalities. In an interview yesterday he said

”Yes Col. Cody will be here and lead the parade. Col. Cody has long contemplated spending his latter days as an educator in a manner to bring the subject of Western story in closer touch and more pleasant conditions to the little ones and with enough ginger to please the middle-aged and be of realistic reminiscence to the old-timers, pioneers and early settlers of the West. His choice fell upon the Sells-Floto show as the best medium on account of its efficient organization its complete covering of all the elements essential to the real family holiday carnival and its reasonable taxation for admission.”
