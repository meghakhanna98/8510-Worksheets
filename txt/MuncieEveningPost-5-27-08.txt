BUFFALO BILL AND SOME FEATS OF HIS SHOW


Rough Riders From All Countries, Will Be Present In the Exhibition


Arrangements have been perfected for Buffalo Bill’s show to appear in this city soon. Exactly as given in Madison Square Garden, New York City, when the show opened its tour this spring. The performance will be presented without curtailment or changes of any sort, it is promised.


During the four separate tours of Europe which Buffalo Bill has made, he had presented his historical entertainment in eighteen different countries, before crowned heads and (plebeians?), and in a vast majority of instances where an English-speaking person was a rarity. But in all his travels he has depicted the conquest and eventual civilization of the Indian and has presented scenes of historic events with unfailing fidelity and with success which has astounded the skeptical. He has done more than any other American to open the book of our early history before the eyes of Europeans and they have looked with admiring eyes upon the wonders there unfolded.


The topping features of the program will be the pantimimic mlo-drama[a], “The Great Train Hold-Up” and “The Bandit-Hunters of the Union Pacific,” together with “The Battle of Summit Springs.” These features will depict two important eras in western development -- the conquering and subjection of the barbaric redmen and the fast disappearing hoard of bandits who followed the trail of the colonizer and prayed upon the railroad and express companion in their advance across the plains.
