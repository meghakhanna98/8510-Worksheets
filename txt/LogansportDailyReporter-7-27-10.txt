FIFTEEN HUNDRED TO LAKE

The annual Cass county Sunday school excursion, which left this city this morning at 8.45 o’clock carried 1,500 men, women and children to Lake Maxinkuckee, where they spent the day. The officials in charge of the picnic expected about 2,000 people to take in the excursion, but many children whose parents are of modest means, were given their choice between the lake and Buffalo Bill and Ringling Brothers’ circus and they chose the big shows. Most of the small boys decided that they could take in both shows for fity cents, while they could only spend one day at the lake. Two special trains carried the excursionists to the lake and they will return this evening, leaving there at 6:30 o’clock.

HAVING EASY TIME

The police are enjoying a short vacation, as not an arrest has been made since Monday night. No hoboes have even been picked up and taken to headquarters. This rest will only last a short time, as the police are looking for a busy day Friday, when Buffalo Bill’s show cists the city.
