SLAUGHTER OF HORSES.
Buffalo Bill's Wild West Show Train. Wrecked. Charlotte, N. C., special: One hundred and ten of the ring horses of "Buffalo Bill's" Wild West show were crushed to death in a railroad wreck near Lexington at 3 o'clock Tuesday morning. Among the horses killed was "Old Pap," Colonel Cody's favorite saddle horse. "Old Eagle," the star ring horse, was killed and his mangled body fell on top of one of the wrecked engines. The mules that drew the Deadwood coach were also killed. Colonel Cody spent the day at the scene of the wreck and is heartbroken over the slaughter. He says his loss is $60,000. The accident was the result of a head-end collision between a fast south-bound freight train and the second section of the show train, and was due to a misunderstanding of orders. Several train hands were injured, but no one was killed.
