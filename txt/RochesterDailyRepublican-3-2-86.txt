We notice some elegant work exhibited at different places about town. The one most known and recognized by the people, perhaps, is a life-sized oil painting of Hon. W. F. Cody, or "Buffalo Bill", as he is more familiarly known. This work is an exact counterpart of one made by the artist for Mr. Cody, and is prized very highly by him. It may be seen in Mr. Ches. Chamberlin's show window.
