Luckily for the management, bookings at the Academy for the past week have been few and far in between James A. Herne opened on Monday evening with the "Hearts of Oaks," Considering the weather the house was a good one but the play seemed to give less satisfaction than before, the absence of the inevitable baby going far towards producing such a result, and disappointing the audience especially the ladies. The Tourist failed to put in an appearance on Tuesday as advertised leaving Buffalo Bill to close the week last night to a fair audience in which the society element was conspicuously absence. The anticipated attraction now, is the New York Opera Company who give "The Queen's Lace Handkerchief" on Wednesday evening next. This piece had a most brilliant run at the Casino in New York, and will draw out a large and fashionable audience who will have an opportunity of judging of its merits for themselves.
