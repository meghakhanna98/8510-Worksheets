SHOW TO ARRIVE TO NIGHT. 
Wild West and Rough Riders Coming with Buffalo Bill.
Buffalo Bill's "Wild West and Rough Riders of the World" will arrive sometime tonight from St. Louis, and will pitch tents on the show grounds west of White river. Tomorrow morning the cavalcade of Indians, cowboys, Arabs, Tartars, French, English, German and other horsemen, together with the famous old Deadwood mail coach, will issue from the show grounds for a parade through the downtown streets. There will be an afternoon and an evening performance at the grounds, rain or shine. 
The management promises all the features which have made the show famous in the past, and some new ones from which it claims special merit. One of those is the spectacle which takes the place of last year's Battle of San Juan. This year the audience is sure to be thrilled by an imitation of the siege of Pekin and the battle of Tein-Tsin, showing how the Americans scaled the Chinese wall and relieved the foreign ministers. Among the rough riders this year will be seen a troop of Baden-Powell's cavalry, in the uniform worn in the South African campaign; a commando of Boers in native costume, and a squad of Great Britain's Northwest mounted police. Another new feature is an exhibition of the work of the United States life-saving service.
