BUFFALO BILL'S WILD WEST
Will Exhibit at Evansville, August the 17th, 1907
It is announced that Buffalo Bill has prepared an entirely new exhibition for his home coming tour, after four years abroad. While of course the general style of the exhibition will be the same, there will be a change of scenic features, differing from any that have been seen with the show during the twenty-five years it has been before the public. Col. Wm. F. Cody the last of the great scouts will appear in the saddle at every performance leading his Congress of Rough Riders in some remarkable exhibitions of expert horsemanship. The chief scenic feature will be The Battle of Summit Springs, a reproduction of one of the deciding conflicts in Indian warfare, a battle in which Col. Cody participated and in which he shot and killed Chief Tall Bull.
Another pantomimic melodrama will be The Great Train Hold-Up, in which will be depicted the robbery of a train a practical engine cars and a realistic and true-to-life representation of one of the many scenes of lawlessness which the West has known. In A Holiday at T-E Ranch will be pictured the pleasures and pastimes of the plainsmen, cow-boy sports and a dance upon the green. The contrast to this scene of peaceful revelry will be shown in a sudden attack by Indians. The Rough Riders contingent will display themselves in difficult feats of horsemanship hazardous exhibitions of skill and a diverting and exhilarating routine of equestrian expertness and daring.
In short there is no other entertainment like Buffalo Bill's Wild West and after twenty-five years before the public it is more popular than ever, and is in every way better equipped than it has ever been before.
