TICKET SELLER SHOT.
One of "Buffalo Hill'" Employee Probably Mortally Wounded.
NEW YORK, April 2.-Samuel Haller, thirty-eight years old, a ticket seller with Buffalo Bill's wild "West show, was shot and probably mortally wounded this afternoon in a saloon on West Thirtieth street. The shot was tired by William H. Holland, thirty-three years old, a guest at the St. Cloud Hotel. Holland is said to be a Montreal bookmaker. He made his escape and at a late hour to-night had not been arrested. There Is much mystery about the shooting, but the parties had been drinking.

MONTREAL, April 2. W. II. Holland, who shot a man named Haller in New York to-day, Is the proprietor of the National Horse Exchange here, a poolroom. Holland's friends say that he was of a peaceful 
disposition, but some time ago threatened to shoot on sight a man named Von Spiegel, who was the head of a gang that tapped the poolroom wires and got away with $2,500 through the game. His friends
know of no reason why he should have shot Haller,' unless Holland connected him in some way with Von Spiegel.
