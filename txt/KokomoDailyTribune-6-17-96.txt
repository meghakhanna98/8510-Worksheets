Kokomo Daily Tribune June 17 1896 pg 8
The approaching1 visit of Buffalo Bill and his Wild West, his cohort of primitive riders, such as the Indian,
Cowboy, Cossack, South American Gaucho, the Hungarian Magyar, the Asiatic Tartar and the Mexican Vaquero, combined with civilization on horseback in the shape of trained Cavalryman, the genuine veteran soldier of the United States, the French Chasseur, the English Irish Lancers and the German Cuirassiers, form a grand congress of mounted men on horseback such as has never been seen together in any arena in the history of mankind.

The success achieved by this new and enlarged organization exceeds any enterprise of its kind or character ever inaugurated. It excels all tours of either conquering chieftains of history, and travels of all potentates or governmental expeditions, from the fact of its communal component parts and the numbers of people transferred in the retinue of our picturesque prairie product.

No stronger tribute has been paid to it than that of Miss Kate Field, herself a tourist of experience, when speaking of the outfit at the time of its sojourn at the World's Fair. In writing to her paper then she said: "Chicago is to day the center of the United States, and will remain so until the close of the World's Fair.
There is more to see and hear than an ordinary brain can digest in a thousand years. The vastness of the Fair makes it the part of wisdom to use discretion in selection. When I want instructive entertainment without fatigue, when I want a breath of air from the Rockies, when I want to shake hands with 'square' men who can tell good stories and do kind acts with equal facility, and never try to be anybody but themselves, I take a day off and visit Buffalo Bill's Wild West camp, and so does every intelligent visitor who must fain consider that of all the vast and manifold attractions of Chicago and of the great White City, the most marvelous anti soul-stirring of them all is the Wild West Exhibition."
