"BUFFALO BILL" MAKES CHARGES 'AGAINST WIFE 
Says She Tried to Poison Him and Treated His Guests with Discourtesy. 
DIVORCE CASE TESTIMONY 
DENVER, Col., March 23.-Col. William F. Cody, "Buffalo Bill," made a deposition before a notary in this city to-day in the action for divorce which he has begun in Big Horn county, Wyoming. Colonel Cody will sail for Europe shortly and will be absent from the country when his suit is tried. 
In the proceedings to-day Colonel Cody was interrogated by his own attorney and was subjected to cross-examination by counsel for Mrs. Cody. 
"Mrs. Cody tried to poison me three years ago," the colonel testified. "She had frequently threatened to do it. We were visiting in Rochester, N. Y., during the holidays of 1900 and the day after Christmas I was ill. I supposed the turkey and plum pudding 'did not agree with me. She said she would fix me up. She pretended to give me medicine. It was poison. It almost finished me, for I was unconscious for some time. I think it must have been an overdose for it made me vomit and I suppose this saved my life." 
Colonel Cody related many alleged instances of his wife's having humiliated him at his "former home" in North Platte by her conduct toward his guests. "She drove my friends away," he said. "When they were no longer welcome in the handsome residence I built and elaborately furnished it was no longer my home." 
The witness recited many specific instances of his wife's alleged discourtesy to his guests. 
Mrs. Cody's counsel inquired into the character of the guests to whom she objected and into their conduct while at her home. The purpose of the inquiry was to show that the men whom he brought to the house were a fast and riotous set and behaved in such a manner that she had a right to object to them.
