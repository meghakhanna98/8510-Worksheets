Buffalo Bill will be in this city some time in June with his tent show. He has organized a mammoth show for the tenting season, and is called "The Wild West, Cody and Carver's Mountain and Prairie Exhibition." There will be 80 real live Indians, 60 horses, 12 buffalos, 6 Texan steers, a team of 6 elks, the original stage coach in which Horace Greeley made his famous ride. There will be 12 Mexicans and 15 cowboys. The entertainment will consist of chariot racing, buffalo racing, Indian fighting and attacking a stage coach. Capt. Carver and Captain Bogardus will do fancy shooting. Buck Taylor will throw a Texan steer, and there will be a buffalo chase by Mexicans and cow-boys. The show comprises 140 people who camp on the show grounds. A train of 11 cars has been engaged to transport the party. They show on fairgrounds in large cities.
