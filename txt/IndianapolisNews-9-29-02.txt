CODY'S HORSE "SMOKY"
Famous Animal Pictured by Remington Burned to Death
DULUTH, Minn., September 29 - Among eight horses destroyed in a barn which burned in Proctor Knott, to-day, was "Smoky," formerly Buffalo Bill's favorite horse. He was a superb animal in his day, and when he grew old Colonel Cody gave him to his sister, Helen Cody Wetmore, of this city. Frederick Remington's masterpiece is said to be a picture of Buffalo Bill mounted on "Smoky."
