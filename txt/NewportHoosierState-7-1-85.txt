Newport Hoosier State July 1, 1885 pg. 4
Joseph Bauner, a little boy of Ft. Wayne, while playing "Buffalo Bill" with little Frank Bulger, received a charge of pebbles from a pistol, in the eye, causing temporary and perhaps permanent blindness. Little Myrtle Olmeek ran a pin in her eye and will lose her sight. Peter Auth ran a straw in his eye, and is threatened with blindness. If this thing goes on, Ft. Wayne will be a one-eyed community.
