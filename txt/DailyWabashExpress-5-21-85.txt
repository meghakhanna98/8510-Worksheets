Buffalo Bill Prevents a Panic. 
Buffalo Bill's "Wild West" show opened at the Driving Park, Chicago, Sunday afternoon, to an audience of upward of 36,000. The number of tickets sold was 35,837. The grand stand was densely packed, and at one time a disastrous panic seemed imminent. A lot of boys, who had climbed on the tin roof of the building, raised a yell of fire and made a tremendous racket. Instantly there was a stampede, and had not Buffalo Bill, with great presence of mind, coolly resumed his shooting, many lives would have been in danger.
