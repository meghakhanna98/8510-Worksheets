 Up-To-Date Warfare Introduced in Buffalo Bill's Wild West 
Never since the organization of Buffalo Bill's Wild West and Congress of Rough Riders has its success been so pronounced as during the present season. This can be accredited in a measure to the unique general characteristic of the entire entertainment, which is in every respect different from any other exhibition now before the public. One material feature, which has added greatly to the drawing powers of the exhibition, is the timely production of the capture of Pekin. The details of the battle of Tien-Tsin being so recently and firmly impressed upon the minds and hearts of the whole world, that they welcome the enterprise of the management of the Wild West in affording them an opportunity to see this wonderfully realistic presentation of this famous battle; and at the same time, allow them to give expression of their patriotism, almost directly, to the many scores of the heroes of the allied powers. 
The audiences attending the Wild West have been of an exceptional character and have included among their numbers nearly every prominent solider and civilian about the country, and the enthusiasm of sedate old men has been as great as that of the small boy perched on the topmost seat under a tent. Other features that have added new interest to the entertainment includes a detachment of Boers, Baden-Powell's English Heroes, a corps of the U.S Life-Saving service and others that will prove interesting. 
Colonel Cody (Buffalo Bill), is as active in his part of the exhibition as ever before, and his every appearance in the arena is a signal for a large expression of approval from all parts of the enclosure. The sharp shooting of Johnny Baker and Annie Oakley, the rough riding of the Cossacks and soldiers, the tumbling and pyramid building of the Arabs, the lasso throwing of the Mexicans, the bolas pitching of the Gauchos, the "bronco busting" of the cowboys, the peculiar peace and war methods of the Indians- all remain interesting items of the program and are, if possible, better this season than ever before, and will be here on May 22.
