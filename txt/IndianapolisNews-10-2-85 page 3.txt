A Dishonest Agent. The discovery was made here yesterday by W. F. Cody (Buffalo Bill) that one of the agents of his "Wild West" show had been guilty of dishonest practices, in increasing the amount of advertising, doubling it in many cases, and where he could not collect the money himself "standing in" with newspaper publishers, who wittingly or unwittingly helped him in his dishonest purpose. Publishers of two weekly papers here who were approached with such propositions and reported them, which led to the discovery. A nasty examination of the accounts convinced Mr. Cody that he had been systematically robbed all season, and the offender was promptly discharged.
