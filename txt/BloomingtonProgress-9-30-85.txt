Buffalo Bill's Wild West and Sitting Bull; commencing September 30th, at 7th Street Baseball Park, Indianapolis, Ind., during the Indiana State Fair.
Buffalo Bill's Wild West will give exhibitions of Western border life at the 7th Street Baseball Park, at Indianapolis Ind. Commencing September 30th, giving performances daily, rain or shine, during the week of the State Fair.
The performances have been reconstructed and improved, and the company has been enlarged since the last appearance in the city. The latest acquisition is the renowned Sioux Chief, Sitting Bull, and several of the celebrated warriors lately among the hostiles, including White Eagle and fifty-two Pawnee and Wichita braves. The program consists of some remarkably astonishing exhibitions of marksmanship by Buffalo Bill, by shooting with rifle and revolver at glass balls, on foot, on horseback, while standing on one spot while the horse is galloping at full speed around the track. He shoots sometimes at three balls at the same time, seldom missing. He also leads the Indians and cowboys in the chase after buffalos and wild Texan steers illustrating the various modes of lassoing, tying and riding off on the cattle after capture. The exhibition also includes feats of marksmanship, or rather, markswomanship, by Miss Annie Oakley, a young lady from the frontier, a celebrated rifle and trap shot, who does some astonishing things with the rifle; also the cowboy kid Johnny Baker and Seth Clover do some remarkably skillful marksmanship.
Buck Taylor king of the cowboys does some wonderful feats in mounting the bucking horses, which are very amusing, picks up his hat and handkerchief from the ground while on his mustang going at full speed.
