RECEPTION

CHARITY $5 --- SHOW $5,000

In yesterday’s issue of the Tribune, a Logansport citizen commented upon the indifferent response to the Salvation Army’s plea for funds to give the poor children of the city a free outing. Less than $5 was contributed to this worthy cause while more than $5, 000 was cheerfully poured into the coffers of the Buffalo Bill show. The same people who let go of their money for the circus streamed past the Salvation Army alms seekers so intent upon reaching the showgrounds that they gave no thought to the call of charity. The performance will be repeated next Thursday when the Ringling’s come and in all probably the local contribution to this great circus will not fall far short of $10,000. We are somewhat careless in our charity when so big an amount goes for personal pleasure, heedless of the opportunity to give the less fortunate a day of joy by adding a few pennies and nickels to the slender fund. It is easy to close purse strings through the lack of sympathy for many forms of charity which aims to brighten the lot of the poor and distressed but how generously the golden stream pours forth to purchase pleasure for one’s self. How eagerly we restrain a charitable impulse by embracing the delusion that the largess may be improperly diverted. And yet the power for good or evil in $4.37 the total sum of Thursday’s donation, is circumscribed and we prefer to believe that it or a much larger amount in the hands of the Salvation Army will do infinitely more good than harm.
