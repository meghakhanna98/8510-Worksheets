Buffalo Bill's Wild West!
An exact representation of Western border life - Interesting, thrilling, exciting, and instructive. Larger and greater than ever. The following are a few of the numerous features: The renowned Sioux Chief Sitting Bull and staff, White Eagle and fifty-two braves. The only one-legged Sioux spy, Frisking Elk. The great markswoman from the Western border, Miss Annie Oakley. Largest heard of buffalo ever exhibited. Grand Indian buffalo hunt known as the "surround." The phenomenal boy shot, Johnny Baker. Cowboy Kid, Seth Clover, the unequalled cowboy shot; shooting at marbles, half-dollars and nickels. Mustang Jack, the champion jumper, jumping over a horse 16 ½ hands high. Buffalo Bill will shoot at clay pigeons from traps; also with a revolver, rifle on foot and on horseback at full speed, at glass balls. Buck Taylor, King of the Cowboys, in novel equestrianism - lassoing and riding of wild Texas steers. Riding of ten bucking horses by ten cowboys, wilder than the horses themselves. One hundred cowboys, Mexicans, Indians and scouts on horseback. Yellow Hand's death by Buffalo Bill. Bucking horses wilder than ever. Music furnished by the famous cowboy band. We fulfill every promise.
