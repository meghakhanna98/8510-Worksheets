PROMOTION

To Change Roads Here

The Big Four company has a contract to haul the Buffalo Bill-Pawnee Bill show from Benton Harbor to Goshen and the Lake Shore will take the show here and haul it to South Bend. In Goshen the show will unload at Purl and Ninth streets, two blocks from the Wurster show grounds. 

The local location, the advance brigade says, is one of the shorted hauls on the entire tour.
