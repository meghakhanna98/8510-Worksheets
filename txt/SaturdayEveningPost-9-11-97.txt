A Historic Character 
A Latter-Day hero, not only of Romance, but of reality. 
One American, whose actual life experiences exceed anything yet written in romance, is the hero of the plains, Col. W. F. Cody, or, as he is better known, Buffalo Bill. For many years no name has been so often mentioned in the war office reports as that of Col. Cody. In the writing of Gen. Custer, Logan, and Sheridan, as well as many other famous Indian fighters, Col. Cody is a prominent figure, and has always been held as the ideal scout and courageous soldier, and a patriot of the stamp of those which the great West now owes its present prosperity. No thoughtful person can hesitate to give such men as Wild Bill, California Joe, Frank Gruard, Maj. Frank North, and last, but not least, Buffalo Bill, the underlying gratitude they deserve. Of these brave men who guided out little frontier regiments in and out of the hostile countries, who rode by day and night to fight and dies beside the wagon train or adobe cabin of some unfortunate settler, Buffalo Bill remains alone. The history of his life is but a part of that of his country. Therefore, to see this remarkable man in all his strength and picturesque fidelity at the head of this great historic reproduction is an opportunity none should let slip by. 
His Wild West exhibition this year is more attractive than ever, having been improved and enlarged in many ways. It will be seen here on Saturday, September 25th.
