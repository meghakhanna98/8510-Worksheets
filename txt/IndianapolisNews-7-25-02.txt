John Sullivan, a portion of the court house's human equipment, is a son of the soil that grows potatoes and is known as "Th' Ould Sod." Sullivan has a relative that traveled throughout the United Kingdom with Buffalo Bill's Wild West Show. This cousin of "Jawn's" came to America several years ago and when Buffalo bill began picking up material for his foreign show he was among the first to apply for the job. Bill accepted him. 
When the Cody aggregation had been in London about four weeks, Colonel Cody was approached by one of his Indians. 
"Well, what can I do for you today, Fly-In-The-Gravy?"
The Indian feared to make known his desires. Colonel Cody was noted for his kindness to his employees and he again insisted on having Fly-in-the-Gravy make his wants known. 
"If there is anything I can do for you, I hope you will make it known," insisted the old scout. 
"Oi was just th'inkin' thot now wud be a splindid opporchunity for me t' visit me ould home," timidly answered the Indian. 
"How's that?"
"Oi say thot now wud be a splendid opporchunity for me t' visit me ould home." 
"Where is your old home, Fly-in-the-Gravy?"
"In Ballyglenhoe Oireland," replied the Indian, as he wiped a tear from his eye and took a swig or Irish whisky from a flask he had concealed beneath his bear robe. 
And John Sullivan's cousin got a vacation.
