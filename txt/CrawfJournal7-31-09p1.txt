By Buffalo Bill

We will publish the life story of the greatest scout who ever lived, relating in vivid language his experiences following the trail and fighting the Indian, describing many of the most important engagements of the United States troops in their long contest against the red man for the mastery of the plains. 

The first installment will appear on Monday in The Journal.
