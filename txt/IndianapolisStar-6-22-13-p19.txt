A picture of Maj. John M. Burke, advance man for Buffalo Bill, that appeared in The Star recently, has called to the mind of William M. Church, 750 Virginia avenue, experiences that he had with the veteran press agent in 1886 when Burke visited Gordon, Neb., to induce Indians to accompany Buffalo Bill on a European tour.

“I shaved Maj. Burke and combed his hair,” said Mr. Church. “His hair at that time reached to his waist, and I can remember how he tied it up in a roll and placed it under his big hat. He took a car load of Indians from the town. They belonged to a Sioux tribe, and Red Shirt was their chief. 

“After Burke had loaded them into a box car he permitted me to enter the car to talk to the chief. His papoose was there and I gave the little Indian boy a silver police whistle. This so pleased Red Shirt that he took a leather tobacco pouch from his belt and presented it to me. 

“After Burke had taken this outfit to London for Buffalo Bill, the Indian chief and his papoose were received by Queen Victoria. The chief in a short speech said that he had traveled many miles to see the Queen, and that as a result his heart was glad. The Queen complimented Red Shirt for his speech and took the papoose in her arms. This incident was related in the newspapers in many countries. While the Queen was holding the papoose the little Indian, according to newspaper accounts, blew the police whistle that I had given him.”

Burke has friends and acquaintances in all parts of the country and said during his visit here that he usually looks up old comrades in every city he visits whenever he has time.
