HISTORY IN TABLEAUX

Readers of American history, students, pioneers and old settlers who visit Buffalo Bill’s Wild West and Pawnee Bill’s Far East are forcibly reminded of early days by the truly and authentically portrayed scenes of frontier life. It revives memories both sad and pleasant. The school girls and boys are amazed, awestrickened and delighted by seeing true reproductions of their fancies’ dreams of daring achievements on the plains and in the Rocky Mountain fastness in frontier days. The riding of the horsemen representing many nations is also very exciting, for the daring Cossack vies with the reckless cowboy in feats of skill o horseback and stirring contributions to the “strenuous show.” The original and only Col. Wm F. Cody (Buffalo Bill) positively appears at every performance, rain or shine. At Logansport July 29.
