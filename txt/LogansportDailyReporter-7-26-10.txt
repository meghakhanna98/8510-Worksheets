BUFFALO BILL: Wild West and Far East Shows Will Come Here Friday

It is a fact that when Buffalo Bill invaded the east in 1883, with a history of the west on horseback, and familiarized the public with the fact that [text blocked by paper scrap on scan image] frontier history was doomed, its advent gave an incentive to a large wave of immigration on settlement wet of the Missouri than the lack of the sense of security had [text blocked by paper scrap on scan image] before that time. His wild [text blocked by paper scrap on scan image]on was instructive [text blocked by paper scrap on scan image] the then existing knowledge [text blocked by paper scrap on scan image]stern affairs, and of its strange peoples, both red and white. By adding Pawnee Bill’s far east, he has enlarged his school of instruction in a knowledge of the personality of stranger people around the world. In thus enlarging his exhibition he gives an added worth and interest to his farewell tour

The student of American history and the searcher after knowledge of the human race in other parts of the world, can enjoy and profit by no more entertaining, instructive and novel presentation of the subjects than the object lesson in both times that are furnished in the double exhibition – the wild west and far east – the combining of which marks notable event on the eve of Buffalo Bill’s intended retirement – this absolute farewell.

An Indian on horseback, the cowboys on a wild bucking horse, an Mexican with his magic lartat (hard to make out word), and the many world riders, like the Cossack, the Arab, Gauchos, Hungarian Chico, and the myriad of practical riders identified with primitive and military horse history, were absolute myths to the general public in America and Europe, until gathered together by Buffalo Bill in his wild west. [Word smeared over] is now enhanced by the addition of the marvelous study in strange people from around the glove in Pawnee Bill’s far east. This farms a fitting finale to the work as an educator of Col. Cody as he is about to withdraw from the public arena.
