The Wild West
Too Large for Tent or House-Acres of Room Required, and Nothing Less Than a Half Mile Track.
Buffalo Bill's Wild West is a great exhibition, too large to exhibit under a tent or roof, and nothing less than a large field or fair grounds will accommodate it. A half mile or a mile track are necessary to give all the acts. The procession will be half a mile long, and will consist of cowboys, Indians, and many other novelties. In other cities the processions have been viewed by thousands. The show is larger than ever, and presents a greater variety of interesting objects. The grand street parade will be given at 10 a. m. on Monday and Tuesday, and should be witnessed by all who can possibly find time to come down town. The fairgrounds will present the appearance of an Indian camp, and a camp of cowboys. Buffalo and deer will be grazing about, and Indian wigwams will be scattered throughout the grove. Arrangements have been made to run excursions on all the roads centering here, and the country people and residents of the small towns surrounding Terre Haute will be given an opportunity to view the performances and processions of the great Wild West.
