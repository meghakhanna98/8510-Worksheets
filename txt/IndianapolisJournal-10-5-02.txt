Indianapolis Journal Oct. 5 1902
Col. William F. Cody, better known as "Buffalo Bill," has given to Capt. Charles Christy, an old comrade in the early scouting days, a ranch of 160 acres on the Shoshone river, near the National Park in Wyoming. Captain Christy, who was a partner of Buffalo Bill years ago, served the government as a scout under Generals Miles, Custer and Crook, and settled in Denver. Of late years he has not been doing well financially. Colonel Cody has ordered his superintendent to send transportation to his old friend and his wife, and adds that they must take possession at once.
