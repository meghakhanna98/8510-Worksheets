COL, CODY'S WILD WEST.
Some of the Features That Have Made the Show Famous.

Col. W. F. Cody (Buffalo Bill) will be here with his Wild West show for two performances next Friday. The main features which have gone to make up the "Wild West" in past seasons have been retained, hut In addition there is much that is entirely new. Among the new features are typical horsemen from Hawaii, Filipino warriors and a detachment from the famous Roosevelt's Rough Riders, who will be seen as they appeared during their memorable Cuban campaign. The fight at San Juan will be presented and enacted by men who were there and fought, showing an accurate and realistic reproduction of the Spanish fortifications, the field of action and the march and bivouac preceding the fight, with the heroic Rough Riders and horses from Roosevelt's command re-enacting the valorous deeds. Johnny Baker and Annie Oakley will be seen again-in their remarkable exhibition of marksmanship. The United States artillery detachment will again be seen and give an idea of action in the field with cannon.

The different types of horsemanship are revealed in the Congress of Rough Riders, and is made a special feature of the exhibition, serving to bring out the styles of riding of different nations. The American cavalry will give their marvelous feats of horsemanship and engage in spirited rivalry with representatives from the armies of England, Germany and Russia; the Arabs will astound with their dare-devil riding; the cowboys ride bucking broncos and the Mexicans amaze by their facile use of the lasso.
Colonel Cody will be seen in the saddle at each performance and demonstrate again his skill with the rifle. There will be the usual custom followed of having a street cavalcade on the morning of the exhibition through the principal streets.
