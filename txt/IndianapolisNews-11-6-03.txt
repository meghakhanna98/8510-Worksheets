BUFFALO BILL'S STORY.
Tells How Indian Scout Beat Scotland Yard
OMAHA, Neb., November 6.-Colonel W. F. Cody, who is back after an absence of a year, is telling his friends interesting talks of friendship with royalty and about the wonderful success of the Wild West Show with the people of England. He also tells how his tired old Indian scout, Picket Man, recovered a valuable little stick pin presented to Buffalo Bill by Kind Edward, with that monarch's compliments, when the cleverest sleuths of Scotland Yard's force were unable to find it. 
"This trinket was gold, a British crown on a golden mount," said Colonel Cody. "It was stolen from a private tent on the show grounds in London, Scotland Yard detective disguised as laborers and Cossack horsemen, mingled with the employees several days and were not able to guess who stole the keepsake. Picket Man was clever. He spread the news that Patti had given him a diamond pin and then he took naps in the sun outside the tent. When a light-fingered roustabout came after the pin Picket Man captured him and recovered the King's gift from a pawnshop."
