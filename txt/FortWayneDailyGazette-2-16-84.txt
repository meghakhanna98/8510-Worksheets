Buffalo Bill tonight in "The Prairie Waif."

Buffalo Bill, whose name has for years fired the heart of the small and large boy will appear at the Academy to-night and the capacity of the theatre will be severely tested. Mr. Cody is certainly a remarkable man and by no means a poor actor. His play of "The Prairie Waif" has caught on immensely all over the country this year.
