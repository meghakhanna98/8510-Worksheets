The entertainment to be given by Buffalo Bill's combination at the fairgrounds in May will become of the most novel ever seen here. The performance will consist of shooting from horses by Carver, Buffalo Bill and Bogardus; Indian dances; bow and arrow shooting by Indians; cow-boys will stampede a herd of twenty-five buffaloes, and will lasso and wager to bring down a buffalo or wild Texas steer, tying either inside of two minutes. The whole exhibition will represent life in the west.
