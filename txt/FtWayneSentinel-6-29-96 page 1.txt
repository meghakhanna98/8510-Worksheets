Ft. Wayne Sentinel June 29 1896 pg 1

THIRTY TOUGHS
Coming to This City
Lafayette.
From Police Receive Notice of the Being Headed for Fort Wayne.

The police received information this
morning to the effect that a gang of
thirty toughs were headed this way
from Lafayette. Buffalo Bill's show
was in Lafayette on Friday and the
police of that place arrested thirty suspicious
looking men who were on the
streets. They were kept in jail on suspicion
until last night when they were
all turned loose. The message which
the police of this city received was that
the entire gang had started for this
city and would arrive today or tonight.
The officers have been posted and will
promptly take care of every man they
find on the streets who cannot give a
good account of himself tonight. The
gang had better remained in Lafayette
or gone in some other direction, because
the police of this city are right after
such people as they are.
