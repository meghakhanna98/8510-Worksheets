MEANS WHAT HE SAYS: This is Surely Farewell Appearance of Buffalo Bill.

The people like a man who has “done something,” and the fact gives them confidence in his veracity when he “says something.” Mankind acknowledges that Buffalo Bill is a past master in the first proposition, and that gives a certainty to his present announcement that his coming visit is one of farewell. The “old scout” announces that his arenic career, in each and every town visited, will here after be one that makes the parting of the way from his patrons and his retirement to private life in the shadows of the Rocky mountains.

This announcement is made with all seriousness, as he feels that his labors from natural cause soon cease. By taking time by the foreclock, the occasion can be celebrated without the sadness that age and crepitude would create, while ripened vigor and virility add a spirited picture that memory could treasure with a modicum of regret. On this occasion he brings to his auditors a sufficient number of novelties to refresh and brighten the standard program of historic events in Buffalo Bill’s Wild West by an alliance with Pawnee Bill’s Far East. Thus he gives to his old time patrons sufficient newness to the entertainment, while retaining an appropriateness in the character of the additions. He comes July 29.
