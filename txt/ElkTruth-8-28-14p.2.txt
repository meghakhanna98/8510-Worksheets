Sells-Floto Show is Better Than Ever

Buffalo Bill Himself Accompanies Circus to Pitch Tents in Elkhart Tomorrow. 

The Sells-Floto show, conceded monarch of the arenic world will be more complete this season in range of standard features, aided by world picked skillful artists, having a greater number of men and horses and additional animals of zoo and jungle than ever before. They also have enlarged transportations facilities, the largest impervious canvases, with an expanded seating capacity, able to seat 14,000 patrons. 

The 1914 season has a special interest as the Sells-Floto is reinforced by the presence of Buffalo Bill (himself) – Colonel William F. Cody – with red and white prairie rangers, who will add picturesqueness and diversity to equestrianism to the limit. This also creates an increase in novelties, in scope and adds to every former adjunct, but with no increase in price; the management, trusting to public sense of duty to repay in attendance, in their own interest the vast outlay and expense of this home-sharing enterprise. 

The status of the Sells-Floto circus is now of such sterling character that the date of its coming is as important to be noted in advance as to business arrangements, family freedom and paternal duty. It thus ranks among the days adorned in red ink on the calendar-red letter days in anticipation – when all races, all creeds, all classes, all voters bie [sic] to this one shrine-mingle together, smile universally, rub elbows, vote the same ticket, and join in homogenous feeling of good fellowship, freedom from care, and enlarged ideas of the joys of existence and increased love for life. 

You will have a chance to look and judge for yourself. See the free street parade and take advantage and enjoy yourselves with your families. Two performances will be given, one in the afternoon at two o’clock and the other in the evening at eight.
