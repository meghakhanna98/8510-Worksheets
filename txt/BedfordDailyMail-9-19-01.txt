If "realism" is the thing one should not fail to see Buffalo Bill's Wild West. This is real, if anything ever was. From the paint used by the American Indian and the spears carried by Arabs from the Great Sahara to the modern guns used by the Boers and Briton in South Africa, there is no imitation, no sham. It is real, in fact, from beginning to end. This year there are more features than ever. Strathcona Horse, followers of Botha and De Wet, Canadian Mounted Rifles and the soldiery fighting in China for the Allied powers, all are to be found in the great arena of Buffalo Bill's exhibition.
