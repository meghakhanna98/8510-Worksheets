Buffalo Bill's Wild West will give exhibitions of Western border life at the 7th street Base Ball Park, at Indianapolis Indiana, commencing September 30th, giving performances daily, rain or shine, during the week of the State Fair. 
The performances have been reconstructed and improved, and the company has been enlarged since their last appearance in this city. The latest acquisition is the renowned Sioux Chief, Sitting Bull, and several of the celebrated warriors lately among the hostiles, including White Eagle and fifty-two Pawnee and Whita braves. The programme consists of some remarkably astonishing exhibitions of marksmanship by Buffalo Bill, by shooting with rifle and revolver at glass balls, on foot on horseback, while standing on one spot and while the horse is galloping at full speed around the track. He shoots sometimes at three balls at the same time, seldom missing. He also leads the Indians and cow-boys in the chase after the buffaloes and wild Texas steers, illustrating the various methods of lassoing, tying and riding off on the cattle after the capture; feats of markswomanship by Miss Annie Oakley, a young lady from the frontier, also the cow-boy kid Johnny Baker and Seth Clover do some remarkable skill as marksmanship. 
Excellent music furnished by the famous Wild West cow-boy band, who perform some very pretty solos. Messrs. Cody & Salisbury, who have a very large capital invested in this enterprise and deserve great credit for the undertaking, for it really is America's National Entertainment. They have been meeting with overwhelming success, and receiving the highest praise of the press.
