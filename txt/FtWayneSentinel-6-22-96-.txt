Ft. Wayne Sentinel June 22 1896
Imitation is the Sincerest flattery, it is said, and so Col. W. F, Cody (Buffalo Bill) has been highly flattered by numerous attempts to imitate his Wild West exhibition. It is not flattering to any part of the public that have been deluded by these imitators into thinking that they have seen a Wild West exhibition unless they have seen Buffalo Bill's. The only genuine exhibition of this sort that has ever been given will be here on Monday, June 29, and Buffalo Bill will be here in person and personally take part in it.
