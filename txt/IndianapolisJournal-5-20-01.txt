The American Cowboy. The easy, unstudied grace, added to the seemingly dangerous recklessness of the American cowboy in the saddle, has always evoked outspoken admiration and wonder. Added to this there appears to be such a perfect accord between the rider and his horse, when the latter has been thoroughly mastered, that would indicate a subtle understanding between the two, at all times directing them alike to the accomplishment of the same purpose. As a consequence the feats of horsemanship performed by the cowboys in Buffalo Bill's Wild West always arouse great enthusiasm and win well-deserved applause. The object lessons they give of the struggle between horse and man for mastery; the triumph of man's intellectuality ever brute force, and the subsequent bond of apparent friendship between the two, can only be seen and understood by a visit to the Wild West. 
These picturesque cowboys will form an important part in the grand street parade to be made upon the arrival of the great aggregation in this city, which will be led in person by Colonel W. F. Cody (Buffalo Bill) to-morrow morning.
