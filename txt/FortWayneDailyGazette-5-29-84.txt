The Democrats had better arrange to keep Buffalo Bill in the city. He is an expert at lassoing black horses. Inter Ocean.

"It will be one or tother," and just as likely as any way "tother" will be the man. Still it will do no harm to hold the "Dime novel hero" to fall back on in case of an emergency.
