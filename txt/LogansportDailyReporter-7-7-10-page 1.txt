BUTLER MAY BE BENEDICT NOW: Buffalo Bill Agent is said to have married.

WORKED ON REPORTER: Lester Murray, General Press Agent for Buffalo Bill, Says he Heard Butler Married Kansas City Girl.

Lester W. Murray, contracting press agent for Buffalo Bill’s Wild West and Pawnee Bill’s Far East shows, which come to Logansport Friday, July 29, who was in the city today, says that he heard from another press agent that Harry E. Butler, formerly of the Daily Reporter staff, now manager of Buffalo Bill car NO. 3, had taken to himself a bride in St. Paul, Minn., last week. Murray did not know how much truth there is in the story, and qualifies his statement by saying that the press agent who told him was told the story by another agent who had heard it from someone else. That is as far back as he has been able to trace it, but he smilingly said that he would not be surprised if it is true.

Butler is supposed to have married a Kansas City society belle. He met her in Kansas City under very romantic circumstances about a year ago, and the decrease in the postal deficit last year, according to Murray, was due to the rapid correspondence which the two kept up. Sometimes the mails were too slow and Butler resorted to the Western Union, and since the new night letter system went into effect, Butler spent most of his evenings in telegraph offices, writing long billet doux at the rate of fifty words for twentyfive cents

Such ardent courtship, even though conducted by aid of Uncle Sam and the buzzing wires, generally leads to marriage, and it would not be at all surprising to his local friends if while engulfed in a temporary brain storm he marched the fair Kansas city girl to the altar and softly repeated: “I promise to love, honor and ob-cherish.”
