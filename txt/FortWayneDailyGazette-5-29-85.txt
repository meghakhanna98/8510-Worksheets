Buffalo Bill To-morrow 
To-morrow is the day for the appearance of Buffalo Bill. What may be expected from his show is thus described in yesterday's Indianapolis Sentinel: "Hon. W. F. Cody's 'Wild West' gave an exhibition yesterday afternoon at the fair grounds to over 3,000 delighted spectators. The expert shooting of Mr. Cody while riding at full speed excelled any of his former efforts in this city and elicited much applause. The fancy rifle work of Billy the Kid, of North Platte, as that of the young lady, were wonderful. The historical stagecoach, with driver and outguard men who had long been in actual service, attacked by Indians in ambush, and repulsed by cowboys and Mexicans, presented a scene full of excitement. The several races, lassoing the buffalo, elk and wild steers, were interesting features, but none so amusing as the efforts of the expert riders to mount several "bucking" bronchos that have always refused being ridden. These obstinate little creatures are not trained to make a showing of wrath, but simply have never been sufficiently conquered to be of service as saddle horses. To this moment we have a kindly pity for the cowboys who made futile attempts to ride "Dynamite" and "Suicide", two of this unruly number. 
As a whole, the rich, gaudy trappings, tent, Indians, cowboys, Mexicans, ponies, cattle and buffalo, present a most picturesque scene and one strikingly similar to genuine frontier life."
