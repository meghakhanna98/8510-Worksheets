Up To Fun and Larks 
[Croffnt's New York Letter.]
The story that lady Mandeville has been robbed of valuable jewels causes a ripple of not unkind merriment here. The fact is, that the Mandevilles are quite poor, getting along by various makeshifts. His lordship has such expensive habits that his father has long since cut him off with a very small allowance, and they came to America merely to "boom the Vanderbilts" in New York society. Lady Mandeville is Mrs. Vanderbilt's sister-in-law. Mandeville is up to fun and larks. 
Last summer the Buffalo Bill combination gave an Indian raiding exhibition at Newport before the upper ten there assembled. When the stagecoach came dashing down into the ravine where the "road agents" lay in wait for it what was the astonishment of the audience to see Lord Mandeville, Isaac Bell, Jr., Kipp, and other New York swells on top of the coach yelling and firing off their guns at the robbers! Mandeville doesn't stop at the Vanderbilts with his wife, but occupies bachelor quarters up Madison avenue. I haven't seen him lately, and it is possible that he has by this time joined the great B. B. combination as one of the regular performers. If his old father should happen to die, though, I suppose he would quit the troupe wherever it might happen to be, go to England, take his seat in the house of lords, and enter upon his dukedom, leaving poor Buffalo Bill in the lurch.
