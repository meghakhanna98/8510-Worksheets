Logansport Chronicle April 18, 1885 pg. 8 
Buffalo Bill is heading this way. He would come here sure if there were bill boards to advertise his show. The Doris circus has rented all of Mr. West's boards. They will be here on May 22. Buffalo Bill wants to come here on May 2. He will exhibit at the Fair Grounds. Hope he will make it convenient, as he has a good show.
