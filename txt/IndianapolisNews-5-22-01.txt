LARGE CROWD AT THE SHOW
Wet Weather Seemed to Interfere Little with Buffalo Bill.
The tent was filled to overflowing at the performances given by the Buffalo Bill Wild West show, yesterday afternoon and evening, the rain in the afternoon and the threat of rain in the evening seeming to hold no terrors for those who wished to see the show. Each number on the program was carried through with swing and dash, and each act was greeted with an unstinted applause. The ground was in bad condition for riding, but the riders seemed to mind that but little, though several of them received rather bad spills through their horses slipping on the wet turf. Among other new numbers on the program was the drill of the coast guard, during which they rescue a sailor from the top of a mast in a most professional and expeditious manner. Besides the new acts all of the old have been retained and brightened up, and even Johnny Baker and Annie Oakley seem not a day older than the day they joined the show ions ago. At each performance yesterday there was considerable grumbling from the crowds on the way to and from the grounds on account of the long waits of the street cars at the river bridge, occasioned by its unsafe condition. Only one car at a time was permitted to cross, and many persons were so firmly convinced that the bridge was unsafe that they dismounted from the cars and walked across the old covered bridge.
