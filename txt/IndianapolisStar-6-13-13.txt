Spend Your Holiday on a Wester Ranch

Out in the ranch country of the West, around Sheridan, Wyoming, or in the Big Horn Basin of Wyoming, where Buffalo Bill founded the town of Cody, the practice is growing for the good, big-hearted ranch people to provide for summer boarders and I don’t know any more interesting and pleasurable way of spending one’s vacation with the wife and children than to go out on one of these ranches and ride and fish for trout (great fishing out there) and eat good, plain, substantial food, and sleep – my how one does sleep after days spent exercising in that wonderful mountain air. This “Ranch Vacation” is a novel idea, but very easily accomplished, for I can tell you about what you can do and how to do it, and what will cost and what you can get and all about it. Just write me and let me suggest a plan for you to follow.
