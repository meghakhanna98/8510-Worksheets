A FEW OF THE 425 HORSES WITH CIRCUS HERE MONDAY

“The camels is comin’-“

And also a new flock of press agents and a bunch of elephants with unpressed trousers and the humpback sacred cattle and the blood-seating behemoth and a lot of other things. For Monday morning, good and early, there will roll into Hammond the long trains of vari-painted cars of the Sells-Floto circus and Buffalo Bill’s Original Wild West. Also, naturally, there will come the leaky blare of the clown band tuba, the howl of the concession man – and, well, a lot of things. For was there ever a circus without “all the cur-i-os-i-ties, ladies and gents, ever conceived for your en-tertain-ment an’ amuse-ment?” Certainly not.

And speaking of curiosities and clowns and cornets and other things of an alliterative nature, there will be many a thing to look at with the Sells-Floto circus this year. Every advance man swears it, the announcement chortles it and the truthful press agents weep oceans of briny, salty eye-swelling tears when there’s the slightest intimation of doubt. And seeing that this is the case, the following statements must be accepted as facts: 

That, first of all, shimmering sun or slanting rain, that circus’ll be here on Monday for two performances, after non and evening. 

That Buffalo Bill will be present in person to lead the parade, to ride around the great arena, to give his famous salute from the saddle and to personally supervise the presentation of the wild west program of the show.

That there will be fort-y-y-y-count’em-clowns.

Reserved seat sale opens Monday morning at 9 o’clock at the Summer’s pharmacy.
