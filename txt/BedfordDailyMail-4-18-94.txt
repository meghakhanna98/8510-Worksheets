Cody's Biography Written Abroad 
The following sketch of Buffalo bill is credited to an English paper by the Savannah News: 
"The cablegrams announce that Colonel Cody, who will be well remembered in London, has returned as Mayor of Nebraska. No better selection could be made. Colonel Cody was a friend of a man named Boon, who discovered Kentucky in 1869. After marrying the granddaughter of a distinguished gentleman names Sitting Bull Frog, Cody was twice Governor of Chicago, and at one time was made Mayor or the Arkansas Legislature. He also served in the Confederate army under Ben Butler, who so gallantly defended New Orleans against General Longstreet. The province of Detroit warded him for his military service by sending him to Congress, where he introduced a bill for the relief of the citizens of Buffalo. It was in this that he got his name of 'Buffalo Bill.' While Mr. Cody has a large ranch in St. Louis, he finds time for literature and writes for the Atlantic Monthly, a newspaper edited by Mark Twain and Uncle Thomas Cabin, a gentleman who made fame by his negro dialect sketches."
