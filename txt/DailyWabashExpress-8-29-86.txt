Cowboy vs. English Riding. Buffalo Bill. The English style of riding a horse, which I notice is much in vogue here, is very showy, but it will not do for long distances. It is too hard on man and beast. Let anyone try to ride a horse fifty miles at anything like apace in this manner, and both he and his animal will be used up at the end of the journey. It is a constant pound, pound, pound on the saddle, and the percussion is too much for a horse or a man to stand. The earl of Dunraven and numbers of other noted Englishmen who hunted with me on the plains, rode that way at first but they soon saw as he said, "what bad form it was," and learned to ride cowboy fashion greatly to their comfort and that of their steeds. "We are all wrong in our ideas of riding, Bill," said the earl, when he had mastered the American style. I feel sure that after the Wild West has been in England, three months you will see a revolution in the manner of riding over there. How do we get such perfect seats by gripping low and accommodating ourselves to every motion of the animal? It becomes second nature after a while, I can tell every move that a horse intends making after I have been on his back five minutes. If you want to see how the art of perfect riding is acquired, watch one little Indian boys playing on the burros and ponies. The instant they are barebacked they have no way of holding themselves on except by griping with the knees. Their legs are not enough to catch under the round of the animal's barrel, and yet a 6-year old youngster will stick on like wax.
