Buffalo Bill's "Wild West" show will exhibit two days, Wednesday and Thursday, at the Seventh street ball park. The Omaha Bee says: "Buffalo Bill has certainly out-Barnumed Barnum in his novel show, with its barbaric splendor, its amusements, its perils, its wild, rough character, now under perfect discipline. It is as decorus as a Sunday school, and far more interesting than a circus."
