Nothing Common in This
People will see at Buffalo Bill's Wild West Show detachments of Uncle Sam's Cavalry and Heavy and Flying Artillery. It will be a sight as rare as it will be a patriotic one, to behold these Defender* of the Flag dash on the scene to the inspiring tune of "Yankee Doodle," and bearing aloft the bright banner of the free, "Old Glory," in amicable alliance with the banners of other great Nations. German and English Cavalrymen will present a novel spectacle which will be of interest to the readers of books, the viewers of paintings and illustrations, and the perusers of history. The Arab, Cossack, Tartar, Indian, Cowboy, the Vaqueros, and Gauchos are rare subjects known in song and story, but never before brought together in one exhibition. This will form an ensemble that may never be seen again, and most assuredly has never been seen here before. This vast organization is backed and managed by the experience, energy, tact, and resources of Mr. Nate Salsbury, Mr. James A. Bailey of the Barnum & Bailey Show, and Colonel William F. Cody, whose joint names constitute a trade mark that justifies the estimation in which the subject is held by all.
On this occasion the details will be attended to by an auxiliary corps so large as to insure every detail of personal comfort and convenience to the auditor to view the entertainment in the same manner as London, New York, Paris, and the Chicago World's Fair, and on the same magnificent magnitude of style. No more can be said to enhance the interest that the subject should naturally arouse. The Wild West will be here on next Saturday, September 25th.
