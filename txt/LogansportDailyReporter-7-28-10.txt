BUFFALO BILL COMES TOMORROW: It will be Old Scout’s Farwell Appearance

EVERYONE SHOULD SEE: This Show Marks the Passing of the Real West – Only a Few of the Oldtimers Survive Time’s Ravage.

There will be no parade tomorrow by the Buffalo Bill and Pawnee Bill shows. This will probably be a disappointment to thousands of people. Who have been looking forward to a big street pageant. The shows are in South Bend today, where they drew record-breaking crowds, and it is expected that this city will be thronged with people tomorrow. The show has been advertised within a radius of thirty miles of this city, and people from all sections will be here to see Col. William Cody in his last appearance. This is the first time the combined shows have ever appeared in this city. Pawnee Bill with his far east show, was in the city about eight years ago, but now the two big shows have merged and the performance is greater than ever. 

Col. Cody himself will appear in the performance tomorrow several times, but this is his farewell appearance, and he will spend the remainder of his days on his western ranch. Major William Lillie, better known as Pawnee Bill, will continue with the combined shows in the future years, and will take the place of Buffalo Bill. 

The show will appear on the Kennedy’s west end addition, and will unload about 6 o’clock in the morning at the Sycamore street Vandalia crossing.
