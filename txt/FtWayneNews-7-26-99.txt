"I'LL YELL LIKE AN INDIAN."
Life in "Buffalo Bill's Tented City," as it is called, is like life in a small village. There are some six hundred persons in the various departments. Many of which have their families with them; the Indians have their squaws and papooses, and the varieties of nationalities, dialects and costumes makes the miniature, city an interesting and entertaining one.

The Indians may be seen eating bundles of moat from their fingers and drinking tankards of iced buttermilk. The Mexicans, a shade more civilized, shovel with their knives great quantities of the same food into the capacious receptacle provided by nature. The Americans, despite what is said of their rapid eating, take time to laugh and crack jokes, and finish their repast with a product only known to the highest civilization - ice cream.

Nate Salisbury, Colonel Cody's partner, and one of the shrewdest men in the show business, had his young son with him one summer season. The boy tried to emulate the Indians in their vocal gymnastics, and the father endured it for a time in silence, but his patience became exhausted. "If you don't stop that bawling, I'll punish you," he warned. The young hopeful paused long enough to reply: "All right, father, you spank, but I'll yell like an Indian, just the same."

The above is but one of the many amusing incidents recited by Miss Mayme Jester, who is in the city in advance of Buffalo Bill's Wild West.
