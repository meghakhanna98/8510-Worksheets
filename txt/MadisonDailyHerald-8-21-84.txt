Mr. Robert Haslam, alias, "Pony Bob," a jolly good fellow, is in the city. Mr. Harlam is the advance agent of William Cody's "Buffalo Bill" Wild West show. His show will be here some time in October, and give an exhibition at Beech Grove Park. It will stop here on its way to New Orleans. They have chartered a boat and a calliope. Mr. Haslam says there is no fraud about the "Buffalo Bill" show. It is the original "Wild West," and will positively show here. Mr. Haslam seems to be a very nice gentleman, and he no doubt represents a good show.
