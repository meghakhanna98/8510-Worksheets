The Late Ned Buntline

……..
On shipboard he broke a small bottle suspended from the yard arm with one shot and cut the cord that had held the bottle with the shot following, and years after, in a trial of skill with Buffalo Bill, Texas Jack and several Indian chiefs he took the first prize for quick, sure aim. His adventures among the Indians would fill volumes. He was a great admirer of the Indian character, though he took no stock in "Cooper's Indians," as he called them.
Ned kept himself constantly before the public in some sensational way. He was a leader of the Know-Nothing movement. Was arrested as one of the principals in the Forrest Macready Astor place riots in New York. He was tried before Judge Charles P. Daly, whom Ned had been attacking for years. The judge magnanimously gave him but one year in the penitentiary. He had already begun to fire the youthful heart with his Munchausen tales, and this he continued to his death. No one can estimate the number of stories he wrote. His income from this source averaged $20,000 a year. During the war he was arrested and confined in Fort Lafayette for overstaying his parole. He had tried nearly everything in his time and it was to be expected he would try the stage. This he did, in company with Buffalo Bill, for whom he wrote a play. Their first appearance was in St. Louis, and as it was new business for them, both became stage struck. Buffalo Bill forgot his part, Ned became boggled, and the play ended in a rolling farce. 
Of late years Buntline was living on his farm in Stamford, N. Y. where he leaves his fourth wife and a family. He was a model of muscular vigor, as his picture indicates, up to the day of his death.
