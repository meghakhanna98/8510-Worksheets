The Wild West Show
35,000 People Saw the Buffalo Bill Exhibition at St. Louis Sunday. On Monday and Tuesday Buffalo Bill's Wild West Exhibition will be here at the Fair Grounds. The parade is said to be a most notable feature. It costs nothing to see it and is well worth coming in miles to witness. It will take place at 10 a. m. There are in the Wild West Exhibition, 225 people and 240 horses. Special cars are used, on last Sunday there were 35,000 people attended the performance at the St. Louis Fair Grounds. 
"I am astonished at the ignorance of some people about our exhibition," remarked the agent today. "One intelligent gentleman asked me why we did not give the show at the Opera House. It is impossible for this exhibition to be given in any house or under any tent. It requires no less than a half mile track."
