PROMOTION

MAJOR BURKE HERE: Arrangements Made for Buffalo Bill-Pawnee Bill to Come to Goshen

Major John M. Burke, representative of the greatest novelty in the entertainment line now extant, namely the Buffalo Bill-Pawnee Bill Wild West and Far East is in the city. Major Burke for 40 years has been identified with the old scout’s career, not only on his world tours but in the last chapter of the real Indian frontier district of the west. 

Major Burke was with Col. Cody in the last Indian campaign known as the Ghost Dance war in 1890 and 1891 and from his experience and knowledge of the Indians, had the honor of being one of the two last Indian peace commissioners named, the other being Major Jesse M. Lee, retired, then a captain. This occasion will be forever noted as the finishing of all Indian wars, none being possible in the future.

The major says that it is over 14 years since Col. Cody has been in Goshen and during those 14 years the managerial efforts have been upward and onward and today culminates in the presentation of not only all the gems of the Old West exhibition – really a replica of Buffalo Bill’s life – to which is added an appropriate companion study of primitive man by the addition of genuine representatives of the different Malasian people from the different points and countries visited by our fleet. 

This gives a magnificent, entertaining instructive exhibition, the peculiar characters, costumes, pasttimes of people from all around the world. Nothing like it has ever been seen before. It’s the first visit to Goshen in its present colossal status and will be noted as the last time of Col. Cody’s appearance here.
