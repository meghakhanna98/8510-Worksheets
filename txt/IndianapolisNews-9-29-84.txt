It was "Ned Buntline," says the Buffalo Express, who made "Buffalo Bill" an actor and showman. Judson was a cavalry soldier during the war, and during service in the far west met Cody, who was then a government scout and guide. Cody's adventures furnished the material and Judson the literary skill (such as it was) for the first "border drama" in which Cody appeared. Judson appeared in it too but the dramatic partnership did not last long-probably (though of this we are not certain) because of Judson's intemperate habits. Judson must now be quite an old man. Forty years ago a Nashville mob hung him to a lamp-post and left him for dead.
