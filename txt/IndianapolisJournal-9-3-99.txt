Indianapolis Journal 3 September 1899
Notes of the Stage
Colonel Cody writes in an exceedingly neat and tasteful hand, rather the chirography of an artist or a literary man. It has none of the expected characteristics of a soldier, scout, Indian hunter and valiant horseman; on the contrary, It Is quiet and exact, with a frankness and rectitude of line and simplicity of capitals which indicate rather hereditary than personal individualism. His Quaker mother might have written just such a hand and probably did, for Mrs. Isaac Cody was a woman of considerable education and refinement. However, Buffalo Bill did not learn to write from his mother. He told me once the first time he felt the necessity of knowing how to write his name he was called upon to sign the army pay rolls for his squad of soldiers and he had to make a cross, and his cultivated mother was mournfully ashamed of her splendid boy. "I just set to and started in learning now to write W. F. Cod v. and the colonel used to say that, charcoaled all over every tent In camp, were horrible attempts to make good 'CV and fine y's' with curlicues at the ends and flourishes everywhere in the capitals. I could make a dandy W in the dirt with my gun long before l had got acquainted with a pen and principally the dust on the alkali trails was my copybook and in the winter the snow was a cinch. I wrote Cody all over the Rocky-mountain snowdrifts, and by logging time I could do a pretty fair signature.
