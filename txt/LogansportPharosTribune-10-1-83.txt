Logansport Pharos Tribune October 1, 1883 pg. 3
The "Buffalo Bill Wild West" show, which has been exhibiting at the fair grounds at Cleveland for the past two days, varied its show battles with a little real fighting. An Omaha Indian named Walker who is down on the bills as "Howling Dog," filled up with bad whisky, and started on the war-path. After he had laid out several fellow associates with the butt of his revolver, he made a charge on Buffalo Bill. The latter successfully dodged two shots, and then knocked down the red man with a shovel. Walker will be laid up about ten days. The other Indians were quite rampant for a while, and it looked as if there would be a small sized war, but quiet was finally restored before hostilities had assumed dangerous proportions.
