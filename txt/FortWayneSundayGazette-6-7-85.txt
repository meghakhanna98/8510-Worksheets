An Elmira, New York, dispatch says: "McCafferty's Wild West will show at Delving Park on Saturday. Buffalo Bill is billed for the same place, June 17. There is a lively competition between the two for billboards, dead-walls and show windows. J. O. Jennings, of the former, and E. A. Wolcott, of the latter, have both been here the past week doing good work for their respective shows."
