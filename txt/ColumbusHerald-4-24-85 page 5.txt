Buffalo Bill and His Great Wild West Company.
Of a performance by Buffalo Bill and his "Wild West" company who are to appear in Columbus, Ind. on the 27th, the Elmira, N. Y., Gazette says:
Fully forty thousand people attended the last day of the fair yesterday, drawn there principally by the century's novelty, Buffalo Bill's Wild West, which is without exaggeration the grandest, most realistic, historic, educative, instructive and entertaining exhibition on earth. An hour before the afternoon performance began the inclosure inside the half-mile track was black and dense with people, who, despite the threats and thrusts of blows of an army of marshals and special police, crowded the track and every inch of hitherto sacred territory. Finally the afternoon performance began, and, after the unique parade, the scene of the attack on the old and dilapidated Deadwood stage coach was enacted in all its realism evoking wildest cheers from 40,000 throats. The people seemed to have gone wild in their curiosity and enthusiasm, and by their demonstrations prevented the fulfillment of the programme. Among the notable features of the show are a grand picturesque camp, three brilliant battle scenes, attacking a stage coach, the pony express, Indian dances, exciting horse races, shooting on horseback, shooting on foot, lassoing wild steers, riding bucking horses, grand buffalo hunt, Indian attack on the cabin. The show lasts about three hours.
