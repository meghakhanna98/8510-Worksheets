Logansport Chronicle January 20, 1883 pg. 8
Buffalo Bill is in New York playing in the Windsor theatre. 
Missing this article (from the left side): Buffalo Bill proposes to star in England next season. This is supposed to have come all out by Fenian exertions, and is one of the most deadly and practical blows yet dealt at the Old Country. John Bull and Buffalo Bill when they meet face to face, will make all cow-herds tremble.
