Buffalo Bill and his "Wild West" will retire from Erastina, State Island, this week. It is announced that it is under contract to be set up in London next year, during the American Exhibition. William F. Cody and Nate Salsbury will take over the entire outfits of Indians, Mexicans, cowboys, mustangs, buffaloes, elk, antelope, deer and steers. This is probably the largest engagement ever made of a theatrical or exhibition character, involving an immense outlay. The average number of visitors to the "Wild West" camp at Staten Island this summer is stated at 20,000 daily, and on July 5 53,000 witnessed the two performances. It is the intention of Cody and Salisbury to visit the chief cities of England, Scotland, Ireland and continental Europe, and their campaign is planned on a basis of two years' absence.
