Fast Trip of Buffalo Bill's Party to St. Louis
The Buffalo Bill party passed the city last night on the Vandalia Indianapolis. It took twenty freight cars to accommodate the party. The run was made in ten hours and forty minutes, including thirteen stops. This is twenty-five miles an hour including the stops, which is certainly fast freight time.
