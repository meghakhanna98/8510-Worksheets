WILD WEST PLEASES,
Buffalo Bill Show Has Good Patronage Satisfies Everybody

Buffalo Bill's Wild West was seen by a large crowd last evening and the performance surpassed all previous Wild West exhibitions. The horsemanship, marksmanship and drills of many kinds were all superb and the Indians were a feature in themselves that made the how a most interesting, one for young and old. Colonel Cody was there himself, appearing on a beautiful charger, his white locks and beard giving him a distinguished appearance. The grand review of the troops of all nations opened the performance. The Indians appeared by tribes with a chief at the head of each band. Then came Mexicans, cowboy rangers, European, African and Asiatic soldiers, and finally the United States cavalry appeared. The spectacle was one that cannot be duplicated anywhere in the world. The troupe of Japanese acrobats with the show is the best ever seen here. The Zouaves drill with astonishing speed and precision, their evolutions being so quick as to dazzle the eye.

The Indian war dance was an interesting feature, as was the pitching of the camp, the lovemaking and the attack and battle Frontier life was shown most realistically. The quadrille on horseback was loudly applauded. The United States cavalry drilled, giving a fine exhibition. The horseback riding of several of the young women with the show was remarkable.
