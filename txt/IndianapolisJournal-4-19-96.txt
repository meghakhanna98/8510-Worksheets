BUFFALO BILL'S WILD WEST. 
It Will Exhibit in The City Two Days Next Month.
 Buffalo Bill's Wild West Show, the same entertainment that was at the world's fair, will exhibit in this city May 8 and 9, on the old show grounds on West Washington Street. Horses and horsemen by the hundreds form the most material part of the show, which will soon be seen here. At the head of them is the dashing cavalier of the frontier. Col. W. F. Cody, or, as he is everywhere known, "Buffalo Bill." While the reproductions of wild life in the West, with Its Indians, scouts, hunters and frontiersmen, will maintain its perennial attractiveness, to very many the evolutions and exhibitions of skill, courage and proficiency of the various horsemen who form the congress of rough riders of the world will be specially interesting and exciting. To a rider the equitation of the North American Indians will be both Interesting and surprising. Next to the Indians in approximate primitive simplicity of outfit for riding are the Gauchos, from the Argentine Republic, representatives of a race of mixed Spanish and Indian extraction, who are all herders of horses, cattle and sheep. 
He employs no steel-bitted bridles, but a sort of leather halter with a very solid bit of rawhide. As all riders know, it is often not easy to get a horse to take in his mouth, a cold and hard metal bit. Some animals have an intense aversion for it and will fight against it. But the Gaucho has a trick of rubbing salt on his raw-hide bit, and the horse once having tasted it is never again unwilling to receive it. The Gauchos are believed to be the best horse-breakers in the world, because they have more patience than any others and give more sympathetic study to the individual disposition of each animal they take in hand.
