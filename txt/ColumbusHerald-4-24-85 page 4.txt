Boston's Complaint to the Prairie Chief 
The Boston Commercial Bulletin says:
No lover of the human race, no man with an eye for the picturesque, but must have enjoyed the very sight of these pioneers of civilization. Never was a finer picture of American manhood presented than when Buffalo Bill stepped out to show the capabilities of the western teamster's whip. Tall beyond the lot of ordinary mortals, straight as an arrow, not an ounce of useless flesh upon his limbs, but every muscle firm and hard as the sinews of a stag, with the frank kindly air of a devoted friend, and a natural courtly grace of manner which would become a Marshal of France, Buffalo Bill, is from spurs to sombrero, one of the finest types of manhood this continent has ever produced. Those who have expected to meet the of class of men usually engaged in the circus or variety business must have been pleasantly surprised in these genuine sons of the plains, every one of whom was stamped with the natural, easy grace and courtesy of manner which mark the man who is a born gentleman.
The "Wild West" is one of the best entertainments ever given here. The programme is as accurate as a photograph of Western life including an Indian attack upon a stage coach, herding of cattle, an elk hunt, horse races and some most marvelous exhibition of riding and shooting. It is worth a trip to the prairies to see the shooting of Capt. Bogardus or the riding of Buffalo Bill.
