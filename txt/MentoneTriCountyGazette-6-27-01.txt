Buffalo Bill's Wild West Show at Warsaw
Saturday, July 13th
People of this vicinity will appreciate the opportunity of visiting Buffalo Bill's "Wild West" show at Warsaw, on the above date, or at Ft. Wayne on Friday, the 12th. 
The Wild West has extended so far West that is has met the East. Buffalo Bill has followed. He has already included Arabs and Cossacks, Filipinos and Hawaiians. Now the Boers have been taken in, and with other new attractions it has become a Wild East as well as a Wild West. The exhibition has become so broad as to reach nearly around the earth, and perhaps the Wild Circle would be a better name for it. 
The remaining title, "Congress of Rough Riders of the World," is more appropriate than ever before. Of course, it is a well-known fact that the words "Rough Riders," were first used by this organization. This season an extra effort seems to have been made by the management to secure special features, and they disclose one that is admitted to be the greatest spectacular production concerning warfare that was ever before attempted, especially by a tented exhibition. It is termed the Battle of Tien-Tsin, a striking representation of the rescue of the representatives of the different powers, who were held prisoners for some time in Pekin. This affair requires the service of over 600 men, who battle as if in reality, thus giving the spectacle a more striking effect. The scaling of the wall is in itself a most picturesque affair, especially at the finish of the spectacle.
