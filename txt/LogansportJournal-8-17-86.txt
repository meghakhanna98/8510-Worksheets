Annual Dog Feast of the Sioux
The Sioux Indians forming part of the Buffalo Bill Wild West exhibition on Staten island, the other night enjoyed their annual dog feast. There is a superstition among the Indians that if they eat stewed dog on a certain day of each year the feast will bring good luck to the tribe for the remainder of the year. Different tribes designate different days and invest the event with the most supreme importance. The other night was the time for American Horse, chief of the band of Sioux on Staten island, to order the observance. 
A common black, wooly dog was purchased for 30 cents from a boy. Two squaws held the dog firmly while a third, with a piece of timber, knocked its brains out. The carcass was placed over a slow fire till the hair was entirely singed off. One of the squaws then dexterously dismembered the animal, as a butcher carves a sheep. The intestines were rejected, but the liver and heart were carefully set aside, the liver to be fried and eaten by the squaws as an especial reward for their labor, and the heart, being the prize part of the animal, to be reserved for the palates of Chief American Horse and his squaw. The pieces were then put into a cauldron of water and allowed to stew slowly. When the performance of the Wild West was concluded, the Sioux, led by the chief, formed a circle and squatted, with the chief and his squaw a little in advance. The meat was then passed round and eaten in silence, after which there was music and the dog. - New York Mail and Express.
