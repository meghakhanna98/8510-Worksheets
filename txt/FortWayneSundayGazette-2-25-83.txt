Fort Wayne Sunday Gazette February 25, 1883 pg. 2
Buffalo Bill has a peculiar scheme on foot. He is already organizing for a tour that will attract more attention than a dozen circuses. He will start on the first of January with a band of Indians, a herd of buffaloes, a drove of elk and a band of Mexicans, scouts and other frontier characters. With these he will make a summer tour of the country, exhibiting only on fair grounds. The entertainment is so pleasant that patrons of it will be afforded an opportunity of witnessing the hunting and battle scenes so familiar to the people of the far west border.
