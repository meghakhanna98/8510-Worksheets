Pushaluck, a Pawnee Indian with Buffalo Bill's "Wild West" show, now in New York, ran away with a pretty Newark girl who became smitten with him and they were regularly married in Philadelphia. The bride has some $7,000 in her own right, and is respectably connected. She seems happy with her choice, and will go to the reservation with him at the end of the season.
