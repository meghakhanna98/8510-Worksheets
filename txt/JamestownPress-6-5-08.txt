BUFPALO BILL'S WILD WEST
Will exhibit at Indianapolis Monday. June 15.1908.

After four golden and glorious years in Europe Buffalo Bill is home again. Crowds which in size and enthusiasm unprecedented in the annals of out-of-door entertainment have witnessed the brilliant and inspiring program which is presented by Buffalo Bill. The Battle of Summit Springs, historically accurate and thrilling beyond description is the principal feature of the performance and during the time of its enactment more than one hundred Indians are in evidence. Some of these red men were numbered among the hostiles whom on July 18, 1869 participated in the original battle of Summit Springs, Neb. when Buffalo Bill killed Tall Bull, the Indian's chieftain and turned the tide of victory for the government forces. The Great Train Hold-Up; a Holiday at T-E Ranch, and an attack on an emigrant train are among the other spectacular features. There are rough riders from all nations, bucking broncos without number, dashing western girls and real cowboys and at every performance Col. Wm. F. Cody: the original and only Buffalo Bill rides at the head of his brilliant cohorts, directing the performance and participating in many of the scenes.
