Fort Wayne World May 30, 1885 pg. 1
The Buffalo Bill company appear at the Fair Grounds in their original "Wild West" on Monday and Tuesday next. This company is the best on the road, even excelling Dr. Carver's show, which was presented here last season. Hon. W. F. Cody is a great marksman, and does some wonderful feats on the back of his vicious ponies, with his handsome rifle. It will be a great treat for those who love the excitement of the wild West to witness this well acted, true to nature drama of life on the plains. The bills announce that Buffalo Bill will be at the grounds "rain or shine," so people attending will not be disappointed even show it rain "pitchforks."
