Attica Fountain Warren Democrat Nov. 12 1903
Lee McGowan arrived home last week from Europe where he had been the past two years with Buffalo Bill's Wild West Show. Lee traveled with the show in England, Scotland, Ireland, France, and Wales. Lee will spend the winter in Attica, and in the spring he thinks he will rejoin the Buffalo Bill shows.
