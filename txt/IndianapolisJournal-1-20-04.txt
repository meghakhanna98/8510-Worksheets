The new western drama, "The Virginian," now running in New York, with Dustin Farnum in the title role, is to have a "cowboy night" some evening next week. Col. W. F. Cody (Buffalo Bill) suggested the idea, saying that he would be glad to bring a number of cow punchers, who chance to be in New York, to the performance. Several famous men who have lived on the Western plains have promised to be in the audience.
