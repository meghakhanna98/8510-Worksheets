FAMOUS RIFLE GOES TO WEST POINT: As a token of Esteem to America’s Future Defenders.

In appreciation of the whole-souled loyalty and generous fellowship shown him by the rank and file of the army and in particular the enthusiastic reception given him every season by the West Point Cadets, Col. W. F. Cody (Buffalo Bill) will offer the military academy one of the most valued prizes it has ever received. Col. Cody plans to present his famous rifle to the Cadets as perpetual trophy for marksmanship. 

The rifle in question was presented to Buffalo Bill a year ago by the Winchester Repeating Arms Company, and is an exact duplicate of the rifle made for ex-President Theodore Roosevelt and carried by him all through his hunting expedition. It is a very fancy affair, gold and silver plated, smartly engraved with a name plate encrusted in jewels. The only condition attached to the gift is that it forever remains at West Point, the cadet making the highest score during each year will have the distinction of having his name engraved beneath that of the greatest scout America has ever known – Buffalo Bill. 

Millions of people have witnessed Buffalo Bill’s marvelous shooting with this same rifle, but he has only a few more shots to fire – with Col. Cody’s visit to this city comes an announcement of his retirement from arenic work – it is Buffalo Bill’s final farewell to a nation which has hero-worshipped him this quarter of a century past. And as a fitting tribute to the keen appreciation he holds of his million friends Col. Cody has gathered about him this season a most pleasing entertainment, a congenial combination of stars from two hemispheres – the Wild West and the Far East – the latter being the noteworthy exhibition of Major Gordon W. Lillie (Pawnee Bill), Cody’s business partner, and in whose caretaker the great combined exhibitions go after this season.
