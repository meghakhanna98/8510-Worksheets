The wild Indians, and Buffalo Bill, Dr. Carver and the rest drew like a circus at the exposition grounds yesterday. A stranger might have thought the state fair was on. The show is a remarkably attractive one. This is the last day. 
At the Park, last night, an attractive bill was presented. The most artistic thing on the program was the song and dance business of Misses Smith and Daly. The Indians from the Buffalo Bill troupe, were in the audience, and made most as much fan as any of the actors. They were particularly pleased with the "grand assault at arms" of Maloney and Gray. 
To-morrow night at Meridian Street church will be exhibited Wonderlick's beautiful tableaux of Egypt and Palestine. They are said to be very excellent specimens of art.
