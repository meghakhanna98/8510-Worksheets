Willard Leach, of Clay township, was bound over to the circuit court by Esq. Jackson Wednesday in the sum of $300 for making an assault upon the person of one William Lewis on the fourth of last September. The trial lasted two days and revealed the fact that Clay township is infested with juvenile gang who have undoubtedly been taking lessons from Jesse James and Buffalo Bill.
