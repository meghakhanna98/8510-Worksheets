PROMOTION

CIRCUS HERE NEXT MONDAY HAS DAILY EXPENSE OF $5,000

And now to that old question, How much does a circus cost?

Naturally, the announcements of the Sells Floto Circus and Buffalo Bill (himself), which is coming to Indianapolis next Monday, proclaim in red letters that the admission is 25 cents. The story deals with another subject entirely – the cost of the circus itself.

It takes nearly $5,000 a day to keep the Sells Floto Buffalo Bill Circus alive and going. Salaries for example range from $20 to $500 a week. Capt Durch Recardo, the man who trains lions with a (unknown) whip” gets enough salary in a week to keep the average worknigman six months.

It often costs as much as $2,000 to transport the circus from one city to another. Animals die now and then and an expense of from $200 to $6,000 is necessary to replace them. The railroad equipment of the show cost $200,000 while the horse and their trainers cost as much more. Then there is the expense of feeding and bedding. Five tons of straw are needed every day at the Sells Floto Circus to bed down the animals. 

It costs a good many dollars to bring a circus – at least one like the Sells Floto-Buffalo Bill aggregation – to Indianapolis. And all of this must be made up in 25 cent pieces – the price of admission to the circus.
