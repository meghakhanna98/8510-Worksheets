Buffalo Bill's Great Show
Hon. Wm. F. Cody, better known as Buffalo Bill, with his great combination arrived in the city this morning and at noon made a splendid street parade. At the fairgrounds this afternoon he gave his picturesque and realistic "wild west" to an immense audience. Buffalo Bill never does things by halves, and all who fail to witness the show to-morrow miss one of the best things of their lives. The feats of daring, the border scenes, the chase and other features of life in the "wild west" are simply great.
