SLAUGHTER OF HORSES BUFFALO BILL'S "WILD WEST" SHOW TRAIN WRECKED. 
Over l00 Animals, Including Famous "Old Pap." Crushed to Death Col. Cody Heartbroken. 
CHARLOTTE. N. C. Oct. 29. - One hundred and ten of the ring horses of "Buffalo Bill's" Wild West show were crushed to death in a railroad wreck near Lexington at 3 o'clock this morning. Among the horses killed was "Old Pap." Colonel Cody's favorite saddle horse. "Old Eagle," the star ring horse, was killed and his mangled body fell on top of one of the wrecked engines. The mules that drew the Deadwood coach were also killed. 
Colonel Cody spent to-day at the scene of the wreck and is heartbroken over the slaughter. He says his loss is $60,000. The accident was the result of a head-end collision between a fast south-bound freight train and the second section of the show train, and was due to a misunderstanding of orders. Several train hands were injured, but no one was killed. 
Twelve thousand people greeted the "Wild West" show In Charlotte yesterday, and it left at midnight for Danville, Va. where it was to have made its last stand of the season-. At Danville the show was to have disbanded and the animals sent to Bridgeport, Conn., to go into winter quarters. The show left here in three sections. Near Lexington, as the second section was going twenty-five miles an hour, a fast south-bound- freight train crashed into it. Both engines were wrecked. Next to the engine of the show train there were large stock cars containing the horses, and this is where the slaughter occurred. The ears were smashed into a huge, distorted heap of debris, and only two horses escaped alive. The scene was sickening. From the mass of the wreckage blood poured in a stream that ran alongside the railroad track in a small rivulet. Colonel Cody's engagement at Danville was canceled in consequence of the disaster, which marked the close of a very successful tour.
