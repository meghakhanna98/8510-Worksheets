Buffalo Bill's Wild West, with Sitting Bull, will begin an engagement at 7th Street Base Ball Park, Indianapolis, on the 30th, and continue during the State Fair, and will give performances daily, rain or shine. The show is greatly improved over last year, and the addition of Sitting Bull and other Indian Chiefs gives special interest. The wonderful marksmanship of Buffalo Bill, Miss Annie Oakley, Johnny Baker and Seth Clover; the performance of Buck Taylor, king of the cowboys; the attack on the stage coach by Indians and its defense; the war dance and other Western scenes, all make up an exhibition both exciting and interesting. Twenty buffaloes have been added to the herd of animals, so that the representation of border life is complete.
