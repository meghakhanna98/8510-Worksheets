The History of a Warhorse
(St. Paul Dispatch) 
An officer of the Fourth cavalry says that Buffalo Bill has applied for permission to take the horse Comanche and use him in connection with his theatrical performance throughout the country. Of course his request will not be granted. Comanche was the favorite horse of Capt. Keogh, and was ridden by him into the fight on the Little Big Horn in 1876. He was the sole survivor of the Custer massacre. The horse was found soon after the battle standing in the waters of the river. He had seen wounds, three of them dangerous ones, and had made his way to the river to slake his thirst and allay the fever resulting from his injuries. He was brought to Fort A. Lincoln, and remained there until the headquarters of the Seventh cavalry were moved to fort Meade, where he is at the present time. Comanche originally belonged to Company I, now stationed at Fort Totten, under command of Capt. Nowland, but in 1878 Col. Sturgis ordered the transfer of the horse to the custody of the adjutant of the regiment, and directed that he never again be ridden by anyone. The order also provided that he be properly caparisoned and led in front of the colors at every parade of the regiment. In color Comanche is dark dun, and although over 20 years old, he in excellent condition and frisky as a colt.
